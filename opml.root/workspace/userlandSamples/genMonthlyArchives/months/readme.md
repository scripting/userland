April 2012 = &lt;pre>Great NBA Playoffs RSS feed?	I'm looking for a great feed for news of the NBA playoffs. I want to know the scores as games complete. All the news before the games. Scheduling. Injuries. Nba.com's feed is fairly pathetic. I want a great one. Got a pointer? Trying out Google Drive	I downloaded and installed &amp;lt;a href="http://drive.google.com/">Google Drive&amp;lt;/a> right away of course.	I can &amp;lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BwaL3uwJRaFAbEtmckJEOW9Na00">share a folder&amp;lt;/a> publicly, which is useful.	You can also link to an individual file in Drive. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/05/02/carlosBoozerSmall.gif" width="145" height="161" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named carlosBoozerSmall.jpg">&amp;lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BwaL3uwJRaFAM0k1T0Z2TFFndU0">This link&amp;lt;/a> should take you to a picture of the White House if it's working. Only sort of. It tkes you to a page that includes the picture. I'd like to link to just the picture. Let's see if this &amp;lt;a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JcqVs_RQQUkahYoC6QdOFX5Ha-AAZ6toQsdx7hMLlzC15aA6omJo1zBNBVulpps4-uAF9ARS9NU">link&amp;lt;/a> lasts. :-)	The picture of &amp;lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BwaL3uwJRaFAd3M0eDg5eVBiYWc">Carlos Boozer&amp;lt;/a> to the right was being served from the Public folder of my Google Drive folder, but then the link broke. &amp;lt;i>So you can't point directly to a file. &amp;lt;/i>The link isn't persistent. That's an advantage that Dropbox has. Here's the &amp;lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36518280/misc/carlosBoozerSmall.jpg">link&amp;lt;/a> to the small picture of Carlos Boozer on Dropbox. It won't break.	Drive begins with the same two letters as Dropbox. So when you're typing the name of one into the browser's address bar you'll see the name of the other, if you've been to their website. 	Question -- will Google's search engine go into folders that are marked public. I don't see why it shouldn't. I think they &amp;lt;i>want&amp;lt;/i> to go in there. 	Gotta wonder how long before Google-Plus features show up when you view a folder or a file. Free rent?	Suppose a company said we'll give you an apartment for free, no rent.	One condition -- they can monitor and record everything you do in the apartment. When you come and go. What products you use. Who sleeps over.	Free Internet too, with the same condition.	Would you do it?New EC2 for Poets	I need some people to try out the new "EC2 for Poets".	What's new is that it now gets you through the installation of River2, a river-of-news feed reader and podcatcher. It's updated for the latest changes in the AWS console.	I've also groomed the installation process so there's nothing you need to set up in the "OPML Server" app. Once the server is running, you just install the River2 app (one-click) and you're up and running. At least that's the theory.	It works for me. Does it work for you?	If there are problems, please let me know what you expected it to do, what it actually did. Is the problem reproducible? Screen shots are often helpful. Question about URLs	I want to put a link on every page that gets you the OPML version of the page. The back-end just looks for a format param whose value is &amp;lt;i>opml.&amp;lt;/i> The question is what's the easiest way to specify that.	I could provide the fully qualified URL -- &amp;lt;a href="http://threads.scripting.com/41912ByDw/questionAboutUrls">http://threads.scripting.com/41912ByDw/questionAboutUrls&amp;lt;/a>	Or I could leave out the host -- &amp;lt;a href="/41912ByDw/questionAboutUrls">/41912ByDw/questionAboutUrls&amp;lt;/a>	Or I could leave out the path -- &amp;lt;a href="questionAboutUrls">questionAboutUrls&amp;lt;/a>	But could I leave out everything?	It seems to &amp;lt;a href="">work&amp;lt;/a> in Firefox.	Is it kosher?	PS: I added the feature. Click the orange XML icon at the bottom of this page you &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/04/19/opmlInEditor.gif">get the OPML&amp;lt;/a>. Casual Games for XBOX?	I just got an XBOX 360 without having any idea what I would "use" it for. :-)	I like casual games -- The Sims, Angry Birds, stuff like that. I don't have the bandwidth to get into a massive gaming environment or whatever. I see the things people do with their consoles and it boggles me. 	I got the Kinect, but it's going to take a while to get used to it, and it may not work at all in my apartment because well it's a Manhattan apartment, that means it's smallll. Kinect seems to like more room than I have.	What should I start with? I really liked the sports games on the Wii. 	This is just for fun, to let off a little steam, to distract my mind. 	Thanks in advance for ideas!Readability vs Instapaper&lt;/pre>April 2013 = &lt;pre>Pando depends on its feed	I subscribe to Pando, along with several hundred other feeds in my personal river.	&amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave">http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave&amp;lt;/a>	I click on one link in 100, and I post one or two a year to my linkblog. 	If they improved the quality of their posts, I'd push more of their links. I don't have the largest reader base on the Internet, but I am part of a chain that pushes lots of info and ideas around the net. If you drew a net of the people who follow me and who follow them, it would be pretty damn large. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/30/panda.gif" width="135" height="226" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named panda.gif">I use RSS because it means I can pay attention to more stuff. If for some reason Pando deleted their feed, I would almost never see a link to one of their stories. The other people I follow, and I follow a lot of people, don't seem to know they exist. It's a very small publication, relative to the size of others like The Verge, Mashable, Engadget, TechCrunch, etc. 	Last night Pando ran a &amp;lt;a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/04/29/lets-retire-rss-when-they-retire-google-reader-2/">piece&amp;lt;/a> where they suggested that we "retire" RSS when Google Reader shuts down in July. This was hopefully the last gasp of a malicious thread started by Mike Arrington and repeated by his fanboys, many times over the last couple of years. Their promotion of this idea was out of nowhere, had nothing to do with anything that was actually happening. If they were right, the passing of Google Reader would have happened without any protest. I suppose it's wishful thinking on Google's part that we depended on them to sustain RSS. When the dust settles, I think we'll see that they were &amp;lt;i>stifling&amp;lt;/i> RSS. When competiton enters the picture, when lock-in is no longer an option (and that dies with Google on July 1), we will see the market pick up where it left off before Google entered.  	So to the extent that there was any thought behind Arrington's rants about RSS, it was incorrect thought. He misunderstood what was going on. And the people who echoed his mantra were equally clueless.A song I sing to users	When users ask when a feature will be available, this is what I say.	&amp;lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fQ7uXX9K7Sk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	Software takes time. Good software takes even more time. We know that so we don't make promises about when software is coming. It'll be here when it's ready. What about Feedburner?	It would, imho, be appropriate for users to ask Google what their plans are for Feedburner.	It seems that shutting down that service is even more problematic than the shutdown of Google Reader.	Why? Because it effects everyone who uses RSS, even people who don't use Google products.	There's a real opportunity to do this transition more carefully than the diaspora from Reader.Google Glass is not a trivial product	Watching this &amp;lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/29/chris-dixon-plans-on-investing-in-more-bitcoin-startups-says-more-entrepreneurs-are-getting-involved/">Chris Dixon interview&amp;lt;/a> this morning helped me appreciate that Google Glass has real-world non-trivial applications.	Examples:	1. A teacher giving a lecture while drawing a diagram on whiteboard.	2. As a teleprompter for a person giving a speech.	3. A doctor reviewing test results while examining a patient.	4. An architect looking at designs on a site visit.	5. Watching your heart rate while riding a bike.	6. Sign-language interpreter for a real-time meeting.	7.  In general, as a heads-up display for jobs that require use of your hands and access to information, at the same time.	Honestly, I had not thought of these applications until Dixon explained. 	And of course there &amp;lt;i>are&amp;lt;/i> trivial applications, like watching &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Acres">Green Acres&amp;lt;/a> while pretending to pay attention to someone talking. ;-)Outliners and word processors	I was writing a comment in response to a &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/april/olderTechiesAndOutliners#comment-878360493">comment&amp;lt;/a> from Hanan Cohen, and decided to make it a post. It was getting so long, and said stuff that I wanted to say more prominently.	Hanan said that Word had outlining in the late 80s, and they never took it out. So we should look out for users of that outliner as people who might like &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a>. But I don't look for any magic there, because their idea of outlining and ours are not the same thing.		 It's like the word &amp;lt;i>unconference.&amp;lt;/i> It was a term we came up with for BloggerCon, and then was applied to a very different kind of conference and the result was confusion. That's what outlining in word processors was, from my point of view, confusion.	What they called outlining was more like outline formatting. Putting Roman numerals on the top sections, capital letters on the first level. Numbers on the second and so on.	Word is a word processor. Its primary function is writing-for-printing. The choices the designers made make it a relatively strong formatter and a weak organizer.	Conversely, we can put formatting capabilities into an outliner, but it would behave like an outliner, not a word processor. We fully explored this with MORE, the users loved it, but they still needed to export to Word or Pagemaker if print formatting was important. 	Word is a &amp;lt;i>production tool&amp;lt;/i> -- good for annual reports, formal papers, stories, books. Fargo is an organizing tool, good for lists, project plans, narrating your work, presentations, team communication. You could organize a conference with an outliner. The slides would naturally be composed wiht an outliner. 	An outliner is designed for editing structure more than it is for editing text. The text is sort of "along for the ride." Or you could see an outliner as text-on-rails. Outliner text is always ready to move, with a single mouse gesture or keystroke. You enter text into an outliner so you can move it around, like stick-up notes on a whiteboard. 	The reason a program has to be either a word processor or an outliner is this: There's only one keyboard, and one set of mouse gestures. The identity of a product is determined by choices made by the designer. Word processors are good at selecting words, sentences and paragraphs. Outliners select headlines and all their subs. Shift-click in the two apps do vastly different things, yet in both cases they are "extending the selection." Even the data structures used by the programs are different. Yet superficially they look similar. 	Some great software designers were fooled by this in the first go-around. Probably the guys who did Word thought at first that they were equalling our outliner, but I guess over time they realized what we learned too. That you need to know what your product is supposed to do before you make those choices. Otherwise it ends up as a confusing unusable mess. That's why Lotus 1-2-3 was a magical product, and Symphony, that confronted this problem head-on and didn't solve it (because it doesn't have a solution) never had 1-2-3's balance and sharp-edge feel. Symphony was mush, 1-2-3 was fine. 		Apple's iTunes is another good example. It's all over the map, doing a dozen different things, without a single idea tying it all together. You can tell that the designers are confused too, because in each rev the commands move around and are re-named. Things you depend on disappear, but if you know the magic formula you can make them reappear. One senses that it might be possible to do a beautiful music app that felt wonderful, but if Apple were to produce one, they'd have to start over.	People who used an outliner were never satisfied with what the word processors called outlining. Ultimately that's how you tell what you got. When you sit a person down in front of the keyboard, does magic happen?	BTW, this is great. When I was selling outliners in the 80s there were no blogs, so I couldn't comment on how the various categories of software were handled by reviewers. Now the conversation can be multi-dimensional and lots of learning can happen quickly. Hope! :-)The message of Boston	&amp;lt;i>This post was written quickly.&amp;lt;/i>	It was an interesting week to be in Boston, as in the Chinese proverb about living in interesting times. But not for the reasons people think.	I learned this last night, in a big way, at the &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/berkmanThursdayReunion">Berkman Thursday meetup&amp;lt;/a>. We had about 15 people there, some original people from the old days, and some new people who totally fit in. Having new people there makes sense, because the Thursday group was like that. Every week we'd have a fair number of returning friends, and always a healthy number of newbies.	One man, whose name I didn't catch, said something that I found surprising at first. He said that the press got the story of Boston wrong. The people weren't cowering in fear in their houses as was reported on TV and on Twitter. That was a lie. I admit I found it irrational. Boston is probably about the size of Queens, in geography and in population. If someone was holed up in Astoria, people in Flushing probably wouldn't be too worried. It wouldn't make sense. It would be like worrying that you'd get hit by a bus on any given day. There are a lot of days when no one gets hit by a bus. And even so, the chances of you being that person, well, it's not a smart thing to spend a lot of time worrying about. (Though please, look first before you step out into a street!)	Everyone in the room who was from Boston immediately agreed, enthusiastically. They didn't like that they were being portrayed that way by the media. So we explored the actual story, what was really going on among the people of Boston. The answer was, they were working together to make their city safe. The city hadn't shut down on the Tuesday or Wednesday after the bombing. But on Thursday night, when the bombers were on the run, the police asked everyone to stay off the street. And the people did what they were asked to do, because that's what people do.		One person explained it this way: The police wanted to take all the pieces off the board. So if the bomber started moving he would stand out.	This goes back to one of the themes of my talk on Wednesday night at the Boston Globe. People feel a need to be part of the world they live in. Most of us feel like we're on the sidelines, spectators, consumers, eyeballs, credit card numbers, and that's not what we want. We want meaning. We want to make a contribution. We want do do good and have that good make a difference. If you look at what people actually do, not the stories you read in the paper or hear on CNN, this is obvious. The bombings not only worried people, for a short time when the scope of the danger was unknown, but people also saw the opportunity to get some of the precious stuff, meaning and relevance. 	Why was this a theme of my talk at the Globe? Because the news industry has the ability to offer people exactly what they want, but they won't do it. Their view of the world is that we're out there and they're inside. They talk, we listen. They are relevant, their lives have meaning. The meaning of our lives is not important to them. As long as they view it that way, people will continue to be frustrated by them, as long as they pay any attention. And more and more they're chosing to not pay attention. 	This week the people of Boston learned something about the press because they told a big lie not just about a handful of them, but all of them, collectively. This presents a unique opportunity for a whole city to wake up and take over. I suggested at dinner that the people of Boston buy the Boston Globe, and give it a new direction. You know a city the size of Boston could buy the Globe. And you know what, it's actually for sale. :-)Older techies and outliners	I had a flash yesterday, after doing a series of demos of Fargo here in Boston on this trip and my last one in March. In several cases, the people were close to my own age, and were former users of MORE and ThinkTank. For these people I just needed to show how  Fargo picked up on the ideas in those products and brought them into the technology world of 2013. But in a couple of cases, the people, smart and accomplished, had no idea what I was talking about, so I had to start from the beginning. Just like the old days, before outliners were a semi-major category. I don't mind doing this, I actually kind of like it -- but the engine is rusty. I haven't done this kind of selling in many years.	The conclusion I reached, in an email, trying to explain it to a friend (who is 47) is that if you're under 50 you probably came into computing after the outlining category began to fade. If you're over 50 and a techie, you probably remember at least knowing someone who was a fanatical outliner, whose arms would wave as they tried to explain what they were so excited about. As they spoke, little bits of saliva would drip from the corners of their mouths. Non-inductees of the Club of Outliner Fanatics would stare, not knowing what to make of it. But at least they knew what they were, if only by the reaction they provoked with their acolytes. 	Now, there are companies, notably Omni and Eastgate, who have made a good living selling outliners, all along. I think that's because, while the category hasn't been growing as a percentage of computer use, it is growing in absolute terms, because so many more people use computers today than did in the late 80s and early 90s. 	I have my work cut out for me. I have to explain Fargo to a couple of new generations who don't feel so new, being in their 20s, 30s and 40s. This is going to be fun. ;-)	BTW, my father, who would have been 84 this year, loved my outliners. So it's not just people in their 50s and 60s. Some of the people who could explain why this software is so great, are no longer with us. My dad would have absolutely flipped over Fargo. I think about that a lot. Wish I had done this work sooner so he could have seen it.  How to create an "include" node	My friend Anton Zuiker is our best tester. Anton is a really smart guy. And he's earnest. And doesn't give up. And he makes things break. Which is exactly what you look for in a tester. Because you want to find out about breakage as soon as you break something. Easier to fix then. And it helps make the software better sooner, which is what we're trying to do, all software developers. 	Anyway, Anton wrote me an email this morning asking how to include an outline in another outline. I'm including the full text of his email below. I don't think he'll mind.  		Dave, asking this off-list because I'm not sure you've announced this functionality yet.		Something that I've never grasped is how to include an outline in another outline, or said another way, display Outline1 inside Outline2. I know you've referred to this, and some of the more experienced outliners on the list are mentioning it, but I'm not seeing includes mentioned in the HowTo or Fargo docs.		Sorry for my confusion, but I'm finally at the point where I want to connect my outlines. Am I getting ahead of the feature rollout?	I'm on a train and couldn't think of a better place to answer his question than in a blog post, so here goes.	Headlines in outlines, sometimes called nodes, can have hidden attributes that tell software how to do special things with it. One of the things we can do is include an outline in another. Include is the right word. 	The way you do that is to add a type attribute to the node. The value of the type attribute should be "include" -- leave out the quotes. It should have another attribute called "url" and its value is the address of the outline that's to be included. That's all there is to it. 	Now, how to do that? 	In &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a>, we have a command that lets you edit the attributes of any headline. It's called, unimaginatively, Edit Attributes, and it's in the outliner menu. So if I wanted to add an include node here, pointing to my states outline, I would edit its attributes like this:		&amp;lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36518280/misc/images/atteditor.gif" width="550" height="217" border="0" alt="A picture named atteditor.gif">	The "created" attribute is automatically put there by Fargo, on every headline you create, so we can tell when it was created. It also gives each headline a unique identity, unless you manage to create two headlines in the same second (us programmer types are always thinking about things this way, they're called "edge" conditions, and every one of them eventually happens, it seems).	BTW, I've created such an include node here, as a sub of the headline you're reading right now, so you can see how an include node works.		My Much-Maligned States Outline	I'm sure this is confusing at first. But if you try it out, ask questions, and do it again, eventually it'll make sense. You're learning a pretty cool computer science concept -- pointers. But it's really not that hard, once you understand it. ;-)A semi-luddite view of Google glasses	&amp;lt;i>This was written very quickly.&amp;lt;/i>	At the beginning of my blogging career, in 1994, I &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/14/howtoinvestinpdas.html">expressed doubt&amp;lt;/a> that PDAs would become general-purpose computers. 	Randy Battat, then an exec at Motorola, &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/16/randybattatonpdas.html">rebutted&amp;lt;/a> that people used to say that about personal computers, and that I would come around. I never did, and I was more or less proven right. We're still struggling with mobile devices, trying to figure out what they're good at. One thing they are not, is being a general-purpose computer. The reason is simple. No keyboard. No way around that. Without a keyboard, they are good for reading and relatively short messages. They work well for text messaging and Twitter. I marvel at how some people can write full blog posts and emails with their tablets and phones. But I think that will continue to be something that only some people can do. I'm an excellent typist, but I have to use two index fingers on a virtual keyboard. There isn't room for both my hands. 		Other people opined about PDAs and I ran a &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/17/pdasonparade.html">roundup piece&amp;lt;/a>.	Now to Google glasses. I want to put my stake in the ground. (And I know the product is called Google Glass, but I think they're glasses, so I'm inclined to describe the product my way, without using their brand name (and hence the lowercase G.))	I think they will make an excellent display device for the obvious reason that they're mounted in front of your eyes, the organ we use for vision. The idea of moving your fingers to the side of your head, of winking to take a picture, well I don't like that so much. I admit I might be a luddite here, and am going to keep my eyes and ears open for indications that I'm wrong. It happens, quite a bit when it comes to brand-new tech.	I think they could be a great &amp;lt;i>part&amp;lt;/i> of a mobile computing platform. With more computing power and UI in my pocket, in the form of my smart phone, or in a big pocket, in the form of a tablet. They communicate over Bluetooth, and together form a more useful reading and communication device, but probably still not a very good writing tool. The idea that I would use glasses without tethering them to something more capable for finger-work, well that's what I thought was wrong with the PDA idea in 1994. It turns out, in 2013, for some people -- that the PDA of today &amp;lt;i>can&amp;lt;/i> be used without tethering. But it doesn't have the same utility as the desktop computer I'm typing this blog post on. IMHO of course.Care to Share Your OPML?	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/24/drum.gif" width="135" height="112" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named drum.gif">Interesting &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Daman/status/326888811684573184">question&amp;lt;/a> last night on Twitter from Daman Bahner. He asked how about rebooting Share Your OPML now that there's renewed interest in RSS. That requires a little explaining for people who are not familiar with the original service with that name. 	First, OPML is used to exchange subscription lists between RSS aggregators. I'm the one who made this choice, because I thought it would be cool if people could edit their lists in our outliner (at UserLand) and OPML was the file format of the editor. All our competitors wanted to make it easy for our users to switch to their products, and Radio was the product that got all this RSS stuff going with users, so it became an instant &amp;lt;a href="http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html#subscriptionLists">standard&amp;lt;/a>. And even though few people use Radio today, the choice of OPML is still with us.	If anyone writes a book about how standards &amp;lt;i>really&amp;lt;/i> are developed, the way OPML became the standard for subscription lists would make an excellent counterpoint to the theory that all standards come from deliberative bodies of warring BigCo's. 	Share Your OPML took advantage of the standard. I asked the readers of my blog to upload their OPML files to a server I wrote at share.opml.org. It was later rewritten by Andrew Grumet and then Dan MacTough. That version is &amp;lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061210202820/http://share.opml.org/">visible&amp;lt;/a> today through the Internet Archive.	The reason it became popular? Because everyone who mattered in the RSS world of that day read Scripting News, and I &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ipad+verizon+address+invalid">beat the drum&amp;lt;/a> relentlessly and without shame for Share Your OPML, an idea I totally wanted to see happen. ;-)	How it worked...	When you uploaded your OPML, we added the info to a database.	From that we produced a &amp;lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061212054221/http://share.opml.org/rankings/">top 100&amp;lt;/a> list of feeds. 	We ran an &amp;lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061212054245/http://share.opml.org/aggregator/">aggregator&amp;lt;/a> of the top 100, sort of an early version of TechMeme.	We kept a list of the &amp;lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061212054512/http://share.opml.org/prolificsubscribers/">most prolific subscribers&amp;lt;/a>. 	You could find out who subscribes to a given feed (including your own).	And most important, it would make recommendations, based on the feeds you're following, suggesting feeds that "people like you" also follow. It was very good at this. (Can't show you this page because archive.org wasn't a member, and this was a members-only feature.)	We also had a &amp;lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061212054031/http://share.opml.org/blog">blog&amp;lt;/a>, of course.	You can get an idea of how it works by clicking around the archive. That was the best thing about it. You could lose a lot of time just clicking around and seeing what was related to what.	We had to take it off the air because it was getting too popular and it was a labor of love, not a for-profit business, although it would have made an excellent for-profit business. I wanted to, but failed at finding a programmer to work with me on it. It wasn't the kind of project I wanted to take on by myself. 	Anyway -- today it would still be a good idea, but now I have a &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">startup&amp;lt;/a> that's keeping me busy. 	Daman Bahner asked me about this on Twitter last night, and I asked him to put up a &amp;lt;a href="http://bahner.co/sharing-opmlrss-subscriptions/?buffer_share=0d304">blog post&amp;lt;/a> explaining the idea. And that motivated me to write about it myself. Maybe we can fund this as a community thing. Might be a fun way to do it. Share your ideas, if you find this interesting.	PS: I'm meeting with an old VC friend in Boston later this week. I'm going to suggest they kick in some money for labor-of-love tech projects. That's how a lot of the best ideas develop. What would they get in return? First right to invest in the projects. Seems like a no-brainer (a term VCs like to use a lot). :-)	PPS: I've often wondered if any tech investors read my blog. If you are one, leave a comment, or send me an email. dave dot winer at gmail dot com. I'm interested in knowing if we have any money in our community.Verizon can't take your money	The problem:	1. I have an iPad LTE. 	2. When I was at the Knicks game on Sunday, I wanted to send some pictures to friends, but the iPad said I maxed out my data plan. 	3. I haven't used it once this month. How could that be.	4. Then I remembered. My credit cards expire in May. Maybe that's it.	5. When I got home I checked on the iPad, and sure enough, that was the problem. 	6. I enter the new credit card info, and re-entered my address, as it required me to do, even though the address was the same as last time.	7. Invalid address.	8. Every way I tried to enter the address it objected. I did this for about ten minutes. I thought I would take care of this during halftime of the Nets/Bulls game. We were already well into the third quarter.	9. I decided to call the company and ask if they could just take the credit card info over the phone. After waiting on hold, I was told no, they couldn't do that. 	10. The very nice person said she understood why I was so frustrated (I didn't say I was), and called me by my first name even though I asked her not to.	11. Enter it again, she said. This time it will work. Optimist!	12. I entered it again. It did not work. It's worth mentioning that every time I try, I have to enter my email address and password, the iPad doesn't offer to remember these for me. A lot of hunting and pecking. We repeat this three times. No go. She has no advice to offer, but she is willing to escalate it.	13. Her boss comes on the line, Frankie, who of course understands why I am so upset (this is a script they hired a psychiatrist consultant for) and said I should just enter the information again and this time it will work. I said I was unwilling to do this. He asked is there anything else he could help me with.	So you want to know the answer? 	You have to type the address exactly as it appears in the credit card company account. No variance, not even whitespace. It's not case sensitive (lucky thing because the iPad determines the case and it doesn't agree with my bank's) but otherwise you have to type it literally exactly as they have it. Once I did that, after &amp;lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3052717?start=0&amp;tstart=0">learning&amp;lt;/a> this on an Apple support discussion board, the request went through.	Now tell me something -- why didn't the Verizon people know this? They should hire a systems person not a psychiatrist. Instead of trying to sooth understandably frustrated customers, they should make happy customers, or at least not insanely unhappy customers. Or they could teach their people how to &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ipad+verizon+address+invalid">use Google&amp;lt;/a>. 	Anytime you have to do business with one of these companies you're in for a lot of trouble, that's for sure. 	PS: Apple would like to get in on the Crazy Huge Company game. Look at this dialog that just popped up out of nowhere.		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/23/appleCrazyToo.gif" width="542" height="212" border="0" alt="A picture named appleCrazyToo.gif">		I unplugged it and plugged it back in. All is well. Imagine if the user believed their stupid dialog. New Fargo intro dialog	We've gotten a lot of feedback on the initial user experience for &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a>, and decided to take another look at it. The result is a new intro dialog. Screen shot below.	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8674885729/in/photostream/lightbox/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/23/fargoIntroDialog.gif" width="650" height="383" border="0" style="padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px;" alt="A picture named fargoIntroDialog.gif">&amp;lt;/a>	The actual dialog is a little bigger, the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8674885729/in/photostream/lightbox/">full image&amp;lt;/a> is scaled to fit into the web page.	Let me know what you think of it...	Dave	PS: This is deployed in Fargo 0.51.	PPS: As I was writing this I was thinking of the Matrix. Clicking on the Dropbox button is like taking the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill">red pill&amp;lt;/a>. Clicking on More Info is the blue pill. :-)Where's the app?	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/22/tr.gif" width="95" height="131" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 30px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px; opacity: 0.9;" alt="A picture named tr.gif">In the early days of the web, I remember (vaguely) marveling at the idea that I could put software in a machine that had a persistent  connection and have it be accessible anywhere. This was great until I created something that became moderately popular and learned the wonders of scaling. And then I learned about ISPs who don't react well to outages. After all that it didn't seem so magical.	Today, almost 20 years later, we've pivoted to a new architecture and it's got me puzzled again, at times, looking one way then another trying to find the app, and not getting it right at first -- even though I wrote the app myself. Here's what's weird.	1. Because JavaScript has become such a powerful language that performs so well, you can literally put the code for an app in a web page. To install the app just visit the page. To update the app, reload. Amazingly simple. 	2. But those apps have limited ability to store stuff. &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&amp;lt;/a> proved that even though there are limits, you can still create something useful that runs in the page, with absolutely nothing else. Every computer that runs a modern browser has decided that each virtual "site" can have a few megabytes of storage. That might not be a lot for movies or audio, but for outlines, it's plenty.	3. Enter Dropbox, and presumably Microsoft SkyDrive, Box.net and Google Drive as well, with APIs that add another dimension to what a modern web app can do. Now instead of a few megs of storage that can only be accessed locally, and can't be moved between computers, these services offer &amp;lt;i>gigabytes&amp;lt;/i> of storage, and infinite mobility. The data moves as fluidly as the web itself. This coupled with in-browser JavaScript is enough to make a full-blown computer. The UI is handled by HTML. Logic by JS, and storage by the Box-Drives. 	A user asked if &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a> could write to the local sub-folder of Dropbox even if he didn't have a net connection. I actually had to think for a moment. No, it can't. Think of the circuitous route the data goes through just to end up right back where it started. And think about all the efforts to sandbox web apps so they couldn't get at the local hard drive. That barrier is gone. Now we have to trust the Box-Drive folks to make sure the sandboxes they maintain are really solid. So far they seem to meet the challenge. 	But we are, once again, in a strange new world. Maybe there are ways it will get weary and will break. But if there are, we don't know what they are yet. And for now, it's just a mysterious kind of fun. The gee-whiz factor is high again. ;-)Wish for WordPress and Tumblr	I love that WordPress and Tumblr have APIs. 	However, I wish their APIs were callable directly from JavaScript running in the browser.	As it stands now, &amp;lt;i>unless I'm missing something,&amp;lt;/i> if I want to connect to either service from an app running in the browser, I have to run a proxy server that does nothing more than act as a gateway between my browser-based &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">app&amp;lt;/a> and their server. 	It would be incredibly helpful if they ran that endpoint. They already have to run a server since their apps are entirely server-based. 	We're trying to keep server load to a minimum in &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/fargoPress.html">Fargo&amp;lt;/a>. It's one thing to deploy a server that provides some visible functionality for users, but this is just getting around a limit in the browser.	Over time, more functionality can migrate to the "edge" computer. Smoothing out and optimizing the interface between the browser and the server will help move that process along.	&amp;lt;s>Update: It looks like &amp;lt;a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2">Tumblr&amp;lt;/a> has what we're looking for!&amp;lt;/s>I'm a 57-year-old developer	&amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a> is &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/fargoPress.html">announced&amp;lt;/a> and shipping. You can use it. You can &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8656989197/in/photostream/lightbox/">see&amp;lt;/a> what I've been working on.	Some people have expressed surprise that I'm still programming. Yes I am. 	I had an idea for what I wanted to do when I was 22, and I've pretty much stuck with it. I've had a few detours and setbacks. Some pretty big setbacks. But I kept going. I've always been straight about it. I guess a lot of people didn't believe me. I could tell. And it doesn't feel good, when people -- especially friends -- humor you. Sort of like "isn't it cute the old dude thinks he's a developer." One of the things that comes with age is patience, with stupidity. :-)	I am 57 and I am a programmer, the same way &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese">Martin Scorcese&amp;lt;/a> is 70 and is a movie director. Or &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Howard">Ron Howard&amp;lt;/a> is 59, and &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reiner">Rob Reiner&amp;lt;/a> is 66. And that's just film. It's not unusual for people who decided in their teens or twenties that they were going to be creative in a certain field to stay with it through their lives. I heard an interview recently with Austrian actor &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Waltz">Christoph Waltz&amp;lt;/a> (56), that he considered at a low point in his career possibly being creative in some other area -- painting, or music -- but realized he'd have to put in another 20 years to get started, and when you get going with a career, you know how important the head-start is.		&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bridges">Jeff Bridges&amp;lt;/a> is 63.	I didn't get into programming because I saw it as a way to get wealthy, although I have made enough money to be financially independent. But there's a catch. I was financially independent when I was broke too. If you've chosen a creative path, or more likely if you're compelled by it, or obsessed, or posessed even -- well, it's not about money. It's about expression. It's about bringing change to the world, it's about &amp;lt;i>being&amp;lt;/i> the change. This is not a cliche for me because I've always made tools that were first and foremost designed to help me express.	At 57, yes, probably most of my creative years are behind me. But the best ones are right here and now. 	Why am I so productive again? Because I've hooked up with an excellent programming partner. Every day I revel at how good this guy is. He's 28. Not better than I am, and I am not better than him. We are different, and part of the difference is age. Fargo is very much a product of two generations. This is hardly unprecedented, in most creative areas it's the most common thing. &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock">Hitchcock&amp;lt;/a> worked with young writers and actors, editors, designers. If you want to take a long-term view of an art, you have to have cross-generational sharing. Otherwise you never get anywhere. Yet of course the prevailing wisdom in tech says there's nothing there. That's part of the reason our ship is sailing in circles. :-)	I did my work on blogging and RSS in my 40s. Before that I worked on outlining in my 20s and 30s. Programming languages and databases all throughout. But my real work has been myself. Developing a base of experience that can't come any other way other than by living a creative life.	So if you think creativity in programming is only for the very young, you're thinking about it wrong. I suspect you're probably not yourself a programmer. Yes, some arts and sports do thrive off the youth of their participants, but there's Carmelo Anthony and there's Coach Woodson. Walt Frazier and Red Holtzman. Want to be inspired? Go see &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday">Any Given Sunday&amp;lt;/a>. &amp;lt;i>That's&amp;lt;/i> what I'm talking about.  		&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/myyWXKeBsNk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>Introducing Fargo!	Good morning!	When we started our new company, Small Picture, late last year, we set out to create the most powerful editing environment running entirely within a web browser. 	We believed that HTML 5 is actually a richer environment that the desktop, because of its ability to network. With JavaScript, we could do everything we formerly did on the desktop. And you can install this software simply by visiting a web page. 	But we didn't stop there. We hooked into Dropbox, the deeply transformative and open networked storage environment. Users don't have to export their data. No lock-in here. It's all sitting in a folder on their desktop (and tablet, smartphone, desktop, server, you name it). 	Today, we're ready to unveil the full vision. It runs in any HTML 5-compatible browser, including Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer 10, or Firefox. 	The name of our new product is Fargo.	&amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">http://fargo.io/&amp;lt;/a>	And if you're still here, and reading, thank you. :-)	Here are the bullet points:	1. Fargo is a rich, networked text outliner. 	2. You can use it as a notepad, todo list, to organize projects, narrate your work, for presentations, brainstorming, design, programming, specs. Investors use Fargo to organize deals, lawyers for cases, educators for course outlines, project leaders to organize the work of team members. 	3. Fargo is deceptively simple. You edit documents within documents, nesting them and organizing to as many levels as you need. Reorganize structures with a single gesture. Expand to see the detail or zoom out to see the big picture. 	4. Dropbox is brilliant and transformative. Coupled with the deep power of Fargo, you get a profoundly powerful work environment that goes everywhere. 	5. You can share outlines with friends and co-workers, or publicly.	There's lots more info on the site, but most important -- please try the software. It's right there in your browser. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">http://fargo.io/&amp;lt;/a>	This is the beginning of a journey. We plan to hook Fargo into everything. And because it uses an open document format, OPML, other developers can hook into the idea flow of Fargo users. The possibilities are endless. 	If you've made it this far, thank you so much for your interest and please let me know if there are any questions, feature requests, etc. 	Dave Winer, co-founder&amp;lt;br>Small Picture, Inc. Rollout postponed	We had planned to introduce a new product yesterday, around the time of the tragic explosions in Boston. Of course we postponed the announcement. I'm sure marketers all over the country faced a similar decision, and today are evaluating what to do. 	The best approach to us seems to wait a couple of days and see where we're at. 	However, in the meantime, we have users waiting for the new stuff. So we decided to quietly give our closest users and friends a chance to &amp;lt;i>preview the product,&amp;lt;/i> report on any problems, and in the meantime we can fix bugs and prepare for a formal announcement later this week.	So, without fanfare: &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">http://fargo.io/&amp;lt;/a> is the new outliner from Small Picture. 	In the right margin of the app are links to docs and a press guide.	If you have questions, you can post them here or on the Q&amp;A page for the product, or on the support mail list.	We'll be back with more news later in the week."Assume you saw the news"	When I got back to work at 3:46PM this afternoon, I got a message from Kyle after checking in: "Assume you saw the news."	What. 	The change in body chemistry was palpable. I assume this is a moment I'm going to remember. 	I had not seen the news.	I went to Twitter, but not before imagining what might have happened. I formed a theory. North Korea had destroyed a Japanese city. Or maybe an American city. We're on the verge of World War III.	I found out quickly. Twitter is good for that.	I went back and said: "Wow that was some strong medicine."	The imagination is a powerful machine.Jeff is an idea processor	Jeff Jarvis &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/323807324785483776">loves&amp;lt;/a> whiteboards.	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/15/whiteboard.jpg" width="450" height="228" border="0" lt="A picture named whiteboard.jpg">	I never want to say an idea guy like Jeff is wrong. 	Rather -- there's a tool that could make that kind of work much easier, faster, and get better results. It's called an outliner. I happen to make one.	&amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">http://littleoutliner.com/&amp;lt;/a>	Perfect use-case. 	For an idea guy, an author, an outliner is like a spreadsheet for an accountant.A future Glass service	Someday a VC is going to invest in a startup that:	1. Employs a fleet of Glass-wearing unemployed 20-somethings in major cities.	2. Like &amp;lt;a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/">TaskRabbit&amp;lt;/a>, you can rent these people on an hourly basis. 	3. They will go where you tell them to, and look at what you want them to look at.	4. Public places only. Places where no one has a reasonable &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_of_privacy">expectation&amp;lt;/a> of privacy.	5. You will be able to watch the world through their eyes. 	Lots of applications! The innocent-looking Glass-wearing hipster is spying for your wife or husband. Or your ex. Or your boss. The IRS. :-)Football and publishing	I love &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+football">football&amp;lt;/a> metaphors. 	Visualize this... 	The quarterback pulls back to pass, the defenders rush in, the offensive line holds them back.	Receivers go long, when all of a sudden the defenders turn around and race back to the line of scrimmage.	The quarterback stands there for a moment, shrugs his shoulders and lobs a bomb to one of the receivers, who catches it and trots into the end-zone. 	Fans are agape, chins drop, eyes widen. Huh? What? Is that football?	I see the same thing happening in online news. 	The publishers have fallen in love with paywalls. That's like the defenders retreating back to the line of scrimmage. The quarterback is Twitter. Gradually supporting new media types, bringing in the talent that used to populate television and print with their imagery, songs, athletiticsm, drama, looks, humor, celebrity. The raw materials of media.Busting the fourth wall in TV	Two lovable TV commercial campaigns.	1. &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=geico+pig+commercial">The GEICO pig&amp;lt;/a>.	2. American Airlines hires Don Draper.	They're both playing games with the fourth wall. They're including the viewer in on a joke that the humans don't get.	The pig knows he's a pig, and of course so do we. But the humans, flight attendants, a girlfriend, a cop, don't seem to get it.		&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xJrgcmqbuhQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	Jon Hamm &amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw11W5ckmyg&amp;list=PL43OjlkXFdqYBCNywJAsqReA-hnA4Lpfl">explains&amp;lt;/a> first class to us exactly the way Don Draper explained the Carousel to Kodak. It's amazing to be pitched a real airline by a fictitious character, and one as compelling as Draper. And it's an account the character wanted to close! A big airline. Oh the humanity.		&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/aw11W5ckmyg?list=PL43OjlkXFdqYBCNywJAsqReA-hnA4Lpfl" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>		This is a great commercial, but the last two bits are not necessary. Where the narrator says -- eh, we can talk about it later, that's when the American Airlines logo should come up with the plane soaring through the sky. Fade out. 		The client probably insisted on having the last part. But this is an ad about you and me, not really about the airline. Yes, it's a little self-deprecating on our behalf, but we don't mind because it's Don Draper. He's our friend. And he's telling us something is new at American Airlines. We know he's lying. But we still like it, because it's sweet and funny.	I love being involved in the commercialism. I love that kind of art. Great stuff.Workflowy and Little Outliner	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/11/drum.gif" width="135" height="112" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named drum.gif">&amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&amp;lt;/a> v0.42 is up.	The main new feature in this release is the ability to import outlines from Workflowy, a popular browser-based outliner. 	It would be simpler if they supported OPML import and export, as our outliners do, but you take what you get. The users want to go back and forth, so let's make it as easy as possible.	Here's how you do it.	1. In Workflowy, get the section of the outline that you want to export on screen. 	2. Hover with the mouse just to the left of the main headline and nudge the mouse down to reveal the full menu, and click on the Export command. (&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/11/workflowy1.gif">Screen shot&amp;lt;/a>.)	3. A dialog appears containing the exported text. Be sure to click on the Plain text option. (&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/11/exportDialog.gif">Screen shot&amp;lt;/a>.)	4. Copy all the text, then go to Little Outliner. Position the cursor where you want the text to go, and Paste. (&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/11/fargoText.gif">Screen shot&amp;lt;/a>.)Outlining a meeting	We've been trying some experiments liveblogging with the outliner. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/11/drum.gif" width="135" height="112" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named drum.gif">For now, I think outlining doesn't add much to liveblogging. But there &amp;lt;i>is&amp;lt;/i> an area where I am pretty sure &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">outlining&amp;lt;/a> makes a big difference in a group setting, because we've done it -- in meetings.	You can try it with one other person looking over your shoulder while you outline a project you're doing together. For example, imagine you're buying a house with your spouse. Start by listing all the things you want and don't want in a house. As you list your ideas, the other person will get some too, you add them to the outline. 	Pause for a moment and group them. 	Start listing neighborhoods.	How much money you want to spend.	How many bedrooms. A yard? A nice view? Schools? Close to public transit?	Jump around. If your partner has an idea in one category when you're in the other, just do what they ask. It's about being &amp;lt;b>&amp;lt;i>fluid&amp;lt;/i>&amp;lt;/b> with your thinking. 	Pretty quickly you start using the outline to organize the problem. It becomes a shared space between the two of you, and it really doesn't matter who is at the keyboard, who controls the mouse. The ideas come from both of you. 	The same idea works in a larger context if you can project the outline on a screen.	It can have magical results in organizing a project that has resisted organization.	Don't make a big deal about using the outline at first. It's just being projected, maybe one or two people will start looking at it while you type. Then someone says "Move this item under the other category." They have trouble explaining so they get up and show you. Do what they ask you to do. Now they're controlling the outline by pointing to the projected image of it.	Sometimes the power of technology is less important than the communication between two human beings. 	This process was possible 25 years ago. I know because we did it back then. 	Give it a try. A vision for River of News	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/11/drum.gif" width="135" height="112" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named drum.gif">I had lunch a couple of weeks ago with &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Marshall">Josh Marshall&amp;lt;/a> of &amp;lt;a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/">Talking Points Memo&amp;lt;/a>. They're just three stops south of me on the A train. We should do this more often, political bloggers and tech bloggers getting together to share a meal and talk about what's possible. 	At one point in the conversation Josh asked me what new technology they should be looking at. I didn't hesitate -- I had an answer prepared. This is what I suggested.	1. Let's ask your readers for their OPML subscription lists.	2. Read the lists into a database and rank the feeds, figure out which are the most popular.	3. Then let's start a river with those feeds. Let it run for a few days so all the feeds update a few times, and see what we've got. My bet is that we'll have a pretty fantastic and totally unique news service. 	4. Give it some space on TPM and let it live and breathe. We'll all read this river, and get ideas for more feeds to add to it. You'll learn about other, smaller, political blogs, and they'll get exposure to a wider audience. Win-win. (You'll also run links to stories from Politico and Buzzfeed, so oddly it'll be the place people come to find out what's new on your competitors' sites.)	5. Make deals with them Josh. Ask them if they want to run some TPM ads. Share revenue. 	This is a way to build community in new directions. Encourage people to step out from the discussion boards and start their own pubs. It would instantly make TPM the technology leader in the political blogosphere.	I promised I would write it up so that the idea could be presented to those people in their community who are RSS-savvy. 	This is something I talk about all the time with news people who will listen. You never should have let Google own the news distribution system. But now that they're evacuating, hurry up and fill the void, before another tech giant owns the space. News publishing is something news publishers should at least have a say in. 	Also see my &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/april/anotherPitchForRiverOfNews">pitch&amp;lt;/a> for River of News. We need some updated technology here. My &amp;lt;a href="http://quick.newsriver.org/">River2&amp;lt;/a> software can be a start, but we've figured out how to do it more efficiently since then, with JavaScript and JSON. I don't have the bandwidth now to do the development, at least not at this time, with &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/">Small Picture&amp;lt;/a> actively shipping new products. So there's an opportunity here for techies as well. Another pitch for River of News	I know most of the developers working on replacing Google Reader are doing just that -- creating products and services that do more or less exactly what Google Reader does. 	But there is another kind of aggregator, river of news, and its needs are pretty simple, compared to the Google Reader approach which requires synchronization among different clients. If I had the time here's the software I would write.	&amp;lt;i>A feed scanner that accepts OPML subscription lists and generates &amp;lt;a href="http://riverjs.org/">river.js&amp;lt;/a> files. &amp;lt;/i>	This is the core of a River of News aggregator. It doesn't say how to display it, but there's an excellent jQuery app that does this, written by a group of developers led by &amp;lt;a href="http://river.nicolasgallagher.com/">Nicolas Gallagher&amp;lt;/a>. And it also leaves subscription management to other tools. 	It would be great if this core feed engine could easily be deployed in an EC2 instance and very lean so it could scan lots of feeds for lots of users. 	It would be really nice to have this simple problem solved once and for all. And it's relatively simple compared to the problems of synching.	For some reason this isn't being discussed. It should be. River of News may not be the only way to read RSS-based news, but it's a good way. And for some people such as myself, it's the only one we need. The next Small Picture outliner	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/10/drum.gif" width="135" height="112" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named drum.gif">Good morning and welcome to your &amp;lt;i>Daily Tease&amp;lt;/i> of what's coming soon from your friends at Small Picture (i.e. Kyle and myself). 	We've been working on &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner's&amp;lt;/a> big bro. We're getting close. 	The big thing in this release, other than the ability to edit more than one outline at a time, is that your files reside in a folder in your Dropbox. This gives us the ubiquity we seek for our simple idea outliner, note-taker, todo list, project organizer. 	As we've gotten deeper into this project we've realized more and more that it's the right move. It makes all kinds of things possible. :-)	I expect I'll talk a bit about this in the &amp;lt;a href="http://live.insidethunderdome.com/Event/Live_Chat_Dave_Winer">Thunderdome&amp;lt;/a> chat I'm doing later today, so I wanted the readers of my blog to hear it first. Comments on Arrington/Gawker	1. I am a former friend of Mike Arrington. He was also my lawyer before he was a friend.	2. I don't think what Gawker did was right.	3. An anonymous commenter on TechCrunch said that on any day, any man could be torn apart the way Gawker was trying to tear apart Arrington. I believe that.	4. My fear in speaking was not of reprisal by Arrington,  as an Atlantic &amp;lt;a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2013/04/whos-afraid-michael-arrington/63933/">author&amp;lt;/a> assumes it is, I've been attacked by him at the height of his power, and am still here to tell the tale. The fear is if I stand up and say something I'll be the next one Gawker goes after. 	5. Mike has done things I don't support, that I don't agree with, that anger me, even at times enrage me, but what Gawker has accused him of is one of the worst things you can say about a man. You have to really know that someone is guilty before you make those kinds of charges. I think they know how weak their story is, and it's appalling that they went ahead with it anyway. 	6. Heather Harde's &amp;lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/heather.harde.1/posts/10151502458410999">statement&amp;lt;/a> is the strongest possible endorsement he could get, as a woman who commands a lot of respect in Silicon Valley, her support says all that needs to be said. I encourage Mike to back down now, and let her statement be the end of it. Drew Houston and the role of MIT	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/08/newAccordionGuyBig.gif" width="172" height="259" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named newAccordionGuyBig.gif">I read an &amp;lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/qa/426976/dropbox-founder-drew-houston-simplifies-the-cloud/">interview&amp;lt;/a> with Dropbox founder Drew Houston that ran in MIT Tech Review in early 2012. Really interesting story, well worth a read, especially for this bit about where the idea for Dropbox came from. 	&amp;lt;i>"For me, it goes all the way back to MIT, where there is a campus network called Athena. You can sit down at any of thousands of workstations and your whole environment follows you around: not just your files but where your icons were on your desktop. Then I left and discovered that no one had really built that for the rest of the world."&amp;lt;/i>	I thought -- how interesting, the idea for a hugely important, transformative technology came from using the campus network as a student at MIT.	Then I remembered where Zuck was when Facebook was being hatched. In case you're not familiar with the legend, it was down the street in Cambridge at Harvard. His co-founders were also Harvard undergrads. 	In my own case, the idea for outlining came in a hallway conversation with a fellow grad student at the University of Wisconsin. He told me about editors for Lisp systems that understood structure. From there it was a few steps to editable structures for non-programmers. 	Universities, for people who really use them, can be incredible places to make connections between people and ideas.Why podcasting matters	Earlier I wrote about how &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/april/howPodcastingGotItsName">podcasting got its name&amp;lt;/a>. I wrote it because there's a reporter who says he gave podcasting its name. He didn't. It pisses me off when people who know they didn't do something claim credit for it anyway. I don't need to explain why it's wrong, do I? ;-)	Now, I want to say that even though I have never made a dime off podcasting, and I did a lot of work to make it happen, and I even spent money on it, it was still worth it.	Because it's a form of literature that's valuable and it persists.	To this day, when I go for a walk on a sunny day, or a frigid one, in NY or Seattle or Europe, I can listen to the people that I want to hear from, with no gatekeepers in the middle. I still listen to a lot of programming that is professionally produced, but I think it is better because it has to compete in a free market. One where the cost is pretty close to zero to distribute the programming.	So even though it didn't make me money, it gave me something much better. Ideas! :-)Streisand's money	An interesting chain of thought.	1. I saw a &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fredbenenson/status/320610829177327616">tweet&amp;lt;/a> by Fred Benenson about the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand Effect&amp;lt;/a> which I had never heard of.	2. So I looked it up.	3. Decided to participate, so I &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/320611522822955008">tweeted a link&amp;lt;/a> to the page.		&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Streisand_Estate.jpg">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/07/streisandsHouseInMalibu.gif" width="450" height="233" border="0" alt="A picture named streisandsHouseInMalibu.gif">&amp;lt;/a>	4. Got a &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/smc90/status/320623010761547777">tweet&amp;lt;/a> from Sonal Chokshi saying that Streisand has a shopping mall with all her collections, in the basement of the house.  	5. I thought about being rich. I couldn't imagine that shopping mall really made Streisand feel good. But I imagined that a poor person could dream that it might. I tweeted to that effect. 	That led me to another train of thought that I didn't blog.	I have opinions about what money does to people because I have been lucky enough to have money do it to me. Having money is nice, but not nearly as nice as poor people (which I have also been) imagine it is. But then I wondered how other people deal with money, and I wondered if they all reach this conclusion.	Now, I'm sure I'm right that money doesn't buy happiness, but when you first get that message, what's your response? I think perhaps some people go into denial, and insist that it must. 	What led me to that was a &amp;lt;a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2011/06/06/why-i-still-program/#">piece&amp;lt;/a> I read last week about a guy who, like me, never stopped programming. He had a theory why people think that's unusual. Because being in charge of programmers has more status than being one. The more you are in charge of, the more status. It isn't the quality of the work that matters, it's the size of the subservience. 	It's funny because I never felt this way! And of course since I didn't feel this way, it didn't occur to me that others &amp;lt;i>did. &amp;lt;/i>	I always thought the greatest gift was to be able to do stuff yourself, without having to do it through others. It was the act of creating that was the priviledge. If you had a choice between being a player or a coach, wouldn't everyone choose to be a player? I guess not. 	Mitt Romney is a symbol of this for me. It didn't occur to him, I guess, that we wouldn't love him. If we don't love him, then what was the point of making all that money? I think a lot of rich people never put that to the test, and go through life assuming that they are loved for their money. This explains, imho, a lot of the behavior I see. Being rich seems to equate to "behaving badly."	Another person who helped put this together for me is Frank Langella, in the Fresh Air &amp;lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/08/16/158928812/aging">interview&amp;lt;/a> that ran this week. He recounts what age does to you. And how actors deal with it, or don't. It was both rich and chilling. And a good perspective for anyone who gives money or fame too much credit for giving meaning or happiness to life. 	Time for a walk! :-)How podcasting got its name	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/07/ipod.gif" width="135" height="215" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named ipod.gif">In September 2004, the activity we called &amp;lt;i>audioblogging&amp;lt;/i> was starting to gain traction. There were a dozen or so regular programs. We had tools for creating audioblog feeds, and an aggregator that could pull them all together into a river of audio programming. 	I had my own show, Morning Coffee Notes. Adam Curry had Daily Source Code and together we did a short-lived audioblog called &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=trade+secrets+podcast+winer+curry">Trade Secrets&amp;lt;/a>. Adam was working on an open source tool that would bring Apple's iPod into the mix. In September he opened the iPodder-dev mail list, which I publicized on Scripting News. 	In the first days of the iPodder-dev mail list the term podcast was introduced and adopted as the name of the activity. 	Here's the sequence of events, with links.	1. On September 13, Adam posts the &amp;lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ipodder-dev/message/1">inaugural message&amp;lt;/a> on the iPodder-Dev list. (You will get a warning from Yahoo when you click on the link because the mail list has since been overrun by spam for porn sites. Oh the humanity!)	2. &amp;lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ipodder-dev/messages/1">Lots&amp;lt;/a> of people introduce themselves, including &amp;lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ipodder-dev/message/30">Dannie Gregoire&amp;lt;/a>, a "reasonably competent Perl programmer" from Kentucky. 	3. On September 15, Gregoire posts a &amp;lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ipodder-dev/message/41">message&amp;lt;/a> where he uses the term "podcaster." I read this message, as did Adam.	4. In a phone talk, Adam and I discussed this, and agreed we needed a name for the activity, and that Gregoire's suggested term was pretty good, so we agreed to use it. The conversation was recorded and distributed as one of the Trade Secrets shows. (Note: I'm not sure of the date of this podcast.)	5. &amp;lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ipodder-dev/message/167">Gregoire recalls&amp;lt;/a> the sequence of events in a post to the list on September 20.	6. On September 24, I wrote a &amp;lt;a href="http://secrets.scripting.com/whatIsPodcasting">definitive page&amp;lt;/a> explaining what a podcast is.	7. On September 27, I &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/2004/09/27.html#When:1:35:45AM">decided&amp;lt;/a> to rename the audioblogging session for the upcoming BloggerCon, Podcasting. Adam was the discussion leader.	8. On September 28, Doc Searls wrote a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.itgarage.com/node/462">post&amp;lt;/a> entitled DIY Radio with Podcasting. I couldn't locate a subsequent post where he did a Google search and found zero hits for the term, predicting that there would be a lot more, as the idea caught on.		On second thought, that post might have been written by Rex Hammock. 		Update: Apparently it wasn't Rex, but he has a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.rexblog.com/2009/09/28/20006">quote&amp;lt;/a> from Doc's missing post.	Finally, a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=podcast"> Google Trends graph&amp;lt;/a> clearly indicates that the term was introduced in September 2004. Did something break in Chrome/Mac?	&amp;lt;i>Update: Thanks to elasticthreads, in a comment thread belog, for helping with a few workarounds, and the first one I tried worked. I have a fix I can release if other Frontier/OPML Editor users are seeing the same problem. Right now since I've not heard from anyone, I'm not going to do a release. &amp;lt;/i>	I have a question to ask other people who do web development on a Mac using Chrome. I'm not trying to make news, this is just a question. I'm using my blog to ask it.	1. Back in Netscape days the browser supported a set of interapplication messages called "Apple Events" that allowed other apps to make calls to the browser to get it to do things. 	2. The most useful one, imho, was the GURL message, which said "Here's a URL, please open it in the browser."	3. This feature is deeply integrated in my CMS. I put my cursor on something, right-click and choose View in Browser. It figures out what its URL is and shoots a GURL message over to the browser, and within a second I'm viewing the page.	4. This feature was copied by every browser from then on. You could shoot a GURL over to any of them and they'd open the page. This included Chrome. Until sometime in the last few days. Then it stopped working.		Here's the Apple Event I'm sending:		appleEvent ('rimZ', 'GURL', 'GURL', '----', string ("http://scripting.com/"), 'cwin', nil)		No error is returned, the event eventually times out.	5. I rebooted the system, relaunched the browser and my CMS, it still doesn't work.	So my question is this -- if you do web development on Mac with Chrome, did this stop working for you too?	PS: I started a &amp;lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5503593">Hacker News thread&amp;lt;/a> for this, in case you prefer to comment there.	PPS: Losing this feels like losing the right rear-view-mirror on a car. Very jarring.	PPPS: Gradually our development environment is being whittled away by Google and Apple. If I were paranoid I'd think they want to slow us all down, for some reason. That's the net effect.Pay For Your Sins	Now that I've started a new business, my first business mentor speaks to me again, from childhood. 	My grandfather, &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rudy+kiesler">Rudy Kiesler&amp;lt;/a>, was a businessman. He came to the US during the war, a Jew fleeing the Nazis, with  a few diamonds sewn into my grandmother's coat, which was stolen on the way. So they arrived in the US, to their new home in Brooklyn, like many other imigrants, without a dime. 	He started a sewing shop, and grew it, and grew it, until when he retired after having a stroke in his 60s, he had a dozen factories in the South, and a nice bit of cash in the bank. 	When I was a kid he didn't seem like a wise person. He yelled a lot, loudly, and had hard opinions about everything. But there was an intellect in there. He was a good card player, and a good provider, and he did teach me one important thing about business, an idea that keeps coming up. 	"Pay for your sins," he would say. It's one of those ideas that means different things depending how you approach it. You're going to pay for them, one way or the other. So knowing that, think twice before you do it. And if you try not to pay for them you're only making it worse. There's a compound interest to sins.	Compare this to the lame "Don't be evil" -- which has none of the subtlety. &amp;lt;i>Why not &amp;lt;/i>be evil? My grandfather knew the answer. I do outliners for the thinking	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/03/beetlejuice.gif" width="150" height="178" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named beetlejuice.gif">I love outliner people. They are so cool. 		&amp;lt;i>I love how the new outliner is so lightweight and "transparent", yet powerful. It's a great mind mapping tool sans the cognitive load of layout and "making it pretty". I would love to see native experiences and sync to cloud (Evernote and the like are IMO becoming too heavyweight and start to get in the way of quickly taking notes or thinking)&amp;lt;/i>	When I ship a &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">new outliner&amp;lt;/a> that's where people are looking for them, and today that is on the web -- I get to meet a lot of outliner people. And that makes me feel great!! 	And that gets me thinking about why I do it. Because now the part about whether or not we attract users, which was speculative a couple of weeks ago, is no longer speculative. They are here, and more are coming.	This is why...	We need better tools for thinking. With those tools we might do more of it, and be more effective. I want the thinkers to be more powerful. That's it, that's why I work on outlining software. It's for the thinking.	The rest of it, open formats, keeping choice in the software, valuing users, that's all so we do more thinking.We're not doing software right	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/03/21/without_honeybees_we_may_cease_to_be/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/04/02/bee.gif" width="145" height="105" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named bee.gif">&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/04/a-little-outliner-named-little-outliner/274586/">Nice writeup&amp;lt;/a> by James Fallows of &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&amp;lt;/a>, much appreciated.	The story he tells is pretty typical of the software industry. He wrote about an online outliner a few years ago, but it's gone now. His favorite outliner, Grandview -- long-gone. My early outliners, gone too. A few products took their place, but nothing like the great start we got at the beginning of the PC software era.	What changed is the way we finance software. 	And that seems to be a story reporters appreciate now, because one of their most-used products, Google Reader, is going away. Probably wouldn't happen if a smaller company made it, if they depended on revenue from the product to make payroll.	The wave that's undermining journalism crashed over software many years ago. That's why when journalists want us to make their mission the center of our attention, it's a bit of &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism">narcissism&amp;lt;/a> on their part. Because what's happening to their profession happened to mine long ago.	We human beings aren't that good at creating sustainable systems. The &amp;lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/03/21/without_honeybees_we_may_cease_to_be/">bees&amp;lt;/a> are dying. The globe is &amp;lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/oceans-continue-to-warm-especially-the-deeps/">warming&amp;lt;/a>. And we lose great ideas in software, and it takes generations to reinvent them, only to lose them again. 	I'm bringing back a little of it now. Outliners are my thing. Now let's see if we can make this work as a business. :-)Outliner plug-ins	As you may know, we shipped &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&amp;lt;/a> one week ago today. 	It's done pretty well. I've been watching our stats page regularly and there always seem to be at least a couple dozen people using it. Sometimes as many as a thousand people are outlining with our simple browser-based notepad. 	But all the users, and esp Kyle and myself, want the full-featured product. And we'll have something for you to try out, pretty soon. We did most of the development on the full product before releasing Little Outliner. We wanted to be sure the basic outlining code works, and we wanted to start off with the simple, no-brainer product. 	We will always have Little Outliner, because power-user products can get too complicated for beginners. Just like a ski mountain has a bunny slope, with a hot cup of cocoa close-by, we want to make sure there's a super-easy outliner so people can get comfortable with the idea.	Okay, so we've built a rich product, it's coming soon -- but I want to also hook up tools to produce different ways of viewing text that was written and organized in the outliner. The prototypical example of this is a slide show. That's what MORE did so well, why it won all the awards, and caught the attention of the press and investors, Guy Kawasaki and Apple, and a whole boatload of users. So that's where we begin with the plug-in story today. 	We've created a little slide-show renderer, using the beautiful JavaScript presentations of &amp;lt;a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js&amp;lt;/a>. Then we added an &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/31/screen1.gif">icon&amp;lt;/a> to the left side-bar of Little Outliner that takes the content of the bar cursor outline and shoots it over to the presenter. It in turn sends back the HTML which we then display in a preview &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/31/screen2.gif">window&amp;lt;/a>. All this is done with interfaces that are every bit as simple as they sound. 	All this is accomplished with OPML, which is an incredible way to package up a structure of text to ship between programs. It's almost a whole language unto itself for specifying the arrangement of text. And as you know, we have an easy editor for producing OPML (the world-famous Little Outliner you've heard so much about). And with all the experimentation that's been done in JavaScript tools for presenting stuff, the outliner is the missing element that makes this stuff truly user-friendly. If you don't believe me, have a look at the docs for &amp;lt;a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js&amp;lt;/a>. Or &amp;lt;a href="http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js/">bespoke.js&amp;lt;/a>. Or &amp;lt;a href="http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/#/bored">impress.js&amp;lt;/a>. All of them produce wonderfully animated presentations, but you have to be a real glutton for tech detail to even begin to create your own. But with an outliner it's dramatically easy.	So now we're ready to show, dear developer, how plug-ins will work with our outliner. Right now you have to jump through a few hoops to enable the demo. This howto shows you what to do.	&amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.smallpicture.com/march2013/pluginDemo">http://worknotes.smallpicture.com/march2013/pluginDemo&amp;lt;/a>	Hope you like! :-)&lt;/pre>August 2012 = &lt;pre>We *Really* Built It	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/08/31/webuiltit.gif" width="145" height="109" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named webuiltit.gif">In all seriousness, the Republicans have made an extremely cool invitation to debate who built this country. Were it the capitalists like Mitt Romney, or were it the people who busted their balls to make something happen. Big or small. America is made up of millions of stories. We all have families we're proud of (to some extent at least) and we're not all like the little dude in Monopoly with the tux and top hat. We're dirty and crazy and we love this country. So fuck you Mitt if you think you made this. We made it. &amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/08/31/republican.gif" width="125" height="125" border="0" style="float: left; padding-left: 0; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named republican.gif">And we're not Republicans. 	If I were making signage for the Democrats I'd have lots of &amp;lt;b>We &amp;lt;i>Really&amp;lt;/i> Built It&amp;lt;/b> signs around the convention center. And huge chants with teachers and construction workers and teamsters and immigrants and women -- you name it -- all the people who aren't Republicans -- people who Built It. 	How about a boxing match between a teacher and an actor who looks like Paul Ryan. Obviously the teacher gets to kick "Paul Ryan's" butt. For extra fun have the teacher come from Janesville, WI. :-)	One thing the Dems might not realize is how much pent-up frustration there is with the antics the Repubs have been pulling that have been screwing our country. It really would be nice to direct that hate of all things Republican in some productive direction. International news feeds	I'm putting together a new &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/">tabs.mediahackers.org&amp;lt;/a> panel, a world news river. 	I'm starting with the "international" feeds from major news outlets such as the ABC from Australia, Ria Novosti from Russia, Al Jazeera, Ha'aretz, The Hindu, NYT international feed, etc. 	&amp;lt;b>Here's the current list:&amp;lt;/b>	I'm looking for other feeds. They should be English-language. Cover non-local news for their geography, but not be focused on the United States. We already have lots of American news in other tabs.	If you have any suggestions, please post a comment here. Thanks!! :-)Write a blog post	This is just common sense.	If you want to start a discussion you can write a blog post. It's not as beautiful as some of the new systems. But you're not locking your ideas in a place where they can't be part of any of the systems we've developed on the net for ideas to flow around. And if you don't use those systems we can't make them work better. 	Start a blog on Tumblr or Wordpress.com, if you need to, or use the one you probably already have. Post a link to Twitter so we can see what you have to say. If people want to comment they can. It's the best system we have, until a better one comes along. And &amp;lt;a href="http://branch.com/b/is-branch-another-closed-silo">Branch&amp;lt;/a> is not it.	All they have to do is support feeds to gain parity with the blogging tools. If they do, we can re-evaluate. (Actually they have to support some APIs too, and trackback.)Levity in Republican politics	RNC chairman &amp;lt;a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/priebus-on-romneys-birther-joke-cant-we-have">says&amp;lt;/a> Romney's birtherism is levity in politics. If it were levity it would be self-deprecating. For example Romney making jokes about how his underwear is itching in the heat. Or joking about what his other wives are going to say when he gets home. Forget about his birth certificate, let's see the marriage certificates. All of them. 	Romney, if you want to show you have a sense of humor, show a clip from Big Love at one of the campaign rallies. 	&amp;lt;i>That&amp;lt;/i> would be some levity. Remember where you were when...?	On my way out of Madison yesterday there was a show on the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.wpr.org/wcast/download-mp3-request.cfm?mp3file=jca120824b.mp3&amp;iNoteID=157284">local NPR station&amp;lt;/a> with Tom McBride, a professor from Beloit College, reviewing the touchstone concepts of each of the generations. It was a fascinating show. People my age know what an "icebox" is, not because we've ever used one, rather because the previous generations did. Kids today talk about cc'ing someone, but they don't know where the term came from. And people my age don't really understand why DJs are considered musicians. And some of us know the tech stuff cold, despite what the kiddies think.	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/08/25/moon.gif" width="125" height="125" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named moon.gif">One concept they talked about is what does &amp;lt;i>The Day The Music Died&amp;lt;/i> mean to you. They talked about Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley and Kurt Cobain, none of which are meaningful to me (though I remember where I was when Elvis died, on East Johnson St in Madison). They left out the most meaningful music death of my generation -- &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_John_Lennon">John Lennon&amp;lt;/a>, and yes of course I remember where I was when I heard that.	And today Neil Armstrong died. And yes, I remember where I was the day he landed on the moon. I was at the &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Newport+Folk+Festival+1969">Newport Folk Festival&amp;lt;/a> in Newport, Rhode Island. Thousands of us were watching the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11#Landing">landing&amp;lt;/a> from a small portable TV on top of a VW minibus. I couldn't really see what was happening, but I remember the moment, very emotional, a moment of pride and amazement at what we could do. It was one of those "pinch me" moments. I still feel the emotional charge now, 43 years later. Protocols don't mean much	Three people have asked me to "weigh in" on a new protocol called tent.io. I looked over the site, and I don't understand what I'm supposed to weigh in on. Anyone can write a spec. What matters is what software is supporting the protocol, what content is available through it and how compelling is the content. RSS won not because of its great design, but because there was a significant amount of valuable content flowing through it. Formats and protocols by themselves are meaningless. That's what I say about specs. Show me content I can get at through the protocol, and I'll say something. Chrome RSS breakage, part II	There's a huge thread on the &amp;lt;a href="http://threads.scripting.com/81012ByDw/arrghChromeBrokeRssAgain">post&amp;lt;/a> about the way Chrome has changed its behavior with RSS feeds. 	A recent &amp;lt;a href="http://threads.scripting.com/81012ByDw/arrghChromeBrokeRssAgain#comment-625276350">comment&amp;lt;/a> by Navarr Barnier says that Chome only triggers the new behavior for files with type application/rss+xml, and not for files with type text/xml.	He's got a point. Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.scripting.com/misc/chrometest1.xml">file&amp;lt;/a> I uploaded to S3 with type text/xml. It didn't bring up the crazy dialog that tries to send me to the Chrome store. I got a stylization of an RSS feed. Not exactly what I'd like which is the feed looking like XML. 		&amp;lt;code>s3.newobject ("/static.scripting.com/misc/chrometest1.xml", tcp.httpreadurl ("http://scripting.com/rss.xml", 5), type:"text/xml")&amp;lt;/code>			"http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.scripting.com/misc/chrometest1.xml"	Here's the same &amp;lt;a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.scripting.com/misc/chrometest2.xml">file&amp;lt;/a> uploaded with type application/rss+xml. And sure enough it brings up the dialog.		&amp;lt;code>s3.newobject ("/static.scripting.com/misc/chrometest2.xml", tcp.httpreadurl ("http://scripting.com/rss.xml", 5), type:"application/rss+xml")&amp;lt;/code>			"http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.scripting.com/misc/chrometest2.xml"	The moral of the story is if you can set it up so you serve your feeds with type text/xml, you can circumvent the breakage in Chrome. The question is, should we do this. I'm not convinced it isn't asking for more breakage from them. User-editable structure	There's been a lot of action lately in new web-based content management systems, but imho, all the systems other than the worldoutline software I'm working on, are barking up an wrong, old tree. I had to go on a road trip to figure that out.	Key idea -- there is the equivalent of source code in content. Behind the rendering of pages, of which there can be many kinds, there are words and structure. The words are like the furniture and equipment in an office building. And the structure are the beams, elevators, water pipes, electric lines,  network infrastructure. 	Most content systems have very simple and &amp;lt;i>fixed&amp;lt;/i> structures. Authors and designers can't do anything with the structure. In a way this is good because they don't have to do anything. But eventually this becomes too limiting. It's a limit I haven't had to deal with for a very long time, so sometimes I forget that almost everyone else is living with that limit.	Anyone who has lived in an outliner totally understands the idea of user-editable structure. What's in a tabbed river?	A very quick technical overview of what's in a &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave">tabbed river&amp;lt;/a>.	First, a river is a list of items in reverse-chronologic order from a collection of feeds, also known as a subscription list. 	Feeds are RSS 2.0, 1.0, 0.9x or Atom 1.0. 	Subscription lists are in &amp;lt;a href="http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html#subscriptionLists">OPML 2.0&amp;lt;/a>. An &amp;lt;a href="http://dropbox.scripting.com/dave/readingLists/apple.opml">example&amp;lt;/a> of a subscription list.	The rivers are in a new JSON-based format. &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/houston/rivers/apple/River3.js">Example&amp;lt;/a>.	I would like to see others build on the JSON format, providing new flows, and also providing new user interfaces. 	A tabbed river is a collection of rivers, presented in a tab format. I'm using the &amp;lt;a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tabs">Bootstrap Toolkit&amp;lt;/a> for the tabs. How much does a digital subscription to the NYT cost per year?	At lunch today this question came up and no one knew the answer.	One person asked how much a song on iTunes costs. 99 cents, everyone said.	Seems we should know the answer to the question about the Times.Trying out Medium	Evan Williams just announced a new blogging tool so I signed up. He just sent me an email saying I can post.	After a bit of fiddling around, I can post. &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/08/14/postForm.gif">Screen shot&amp;lt;/a>. 	I have something I want to write about -- the new rivers I just shipped. Especially the &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=apple">Apple river&amp;lt;/a>, which replaces the Olympics as the lead river.	Here's my first post.	&amp;lt;a href="https://medium.com/p/1ded6abb9aec">https://medium.com/p/1ded6abb9aec&amp;lt;/a>	The editor is very nice. Very simple. I think I understand what it is.	1. It's a blogging community.	2. It does categorization, but does it upside-down. Instead of adding a category to a post, you add a post to a category. Maybe a little like Delicious, but with an editor. I never was a big user of Delicious so it's hard to say.	3. It's very bare-bones. But like I said it's nice. :-)	And I appreciate the chance to try it out. 	Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/08/14/about.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a> of the About dialog for the river. I thought I might use it for the picture in my Medium post, but it wasn't the right shape. Neither was the one I used. I think it's really designed for photos. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/08/14/kudos.gif">I got an email&amp;lt;/a> when someone gave some kudos to my post. :-)An open Twitter-like ecoystem	Please read this &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/07/25/anOpenTwitterlikeEcosystem.html">piece&amp;lt;/a> first. Thanks! :-)	All of a sudden lots of people want to talk about this. 	And that's good!	I've been wanting to do that for a long time.	All I have to say is this -- go slowly, and set moderate expectations. Building ecosystems and coral reefs takes time, patience, love and understanding. And maturity. And friendliness. And code. Convert UTF-8 to HTML entities?	I wish there was a simple C routine, possibly table-driven, that converts a string of characters from &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8&amp;lt;/a> to &amp;lt;a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_entities.asp">HTML entities&amp;lt;/a>. Also &amp;lt;a href="http://htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/symbols.html">these&amp;lt;/a>. 	This problem must have come up a million times. I bet it's out there. Do you know &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=C+code+to+convert+UTF-8+to+HTML+entities">where&amp;lt;/a> it is?Madison 8/21 through 8/23	I'm going to be in &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Madison,+WI&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=43.073052,-89.40123&amp;spn=0.058309,0.067377&amp;sll=40.697488,-73.979681&amp;sspn=0.968296,1.078033&amp;t=v&amp;hnear=Madison,+Dane,+Wisconsin&amp;z=14">Madison, WI&amp;lt;/a> for three nights starting 8/21 and leaving on 8/24.	I'll be giving a talk at the technology conference on 8/22. I'm driving from NYC, and bringing my bike. I want to ride around Lake Wingra. I used to that "back in the day." If you have any suggestions on things to do please post a comment here. 	Looking forward to eating some brats and drinking some Leinies. :-)Feeds for my Apple river?	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;no-icons>false&amp;lt;/no-icons>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	When the &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=olympics">Olympics&amp;lt;/a> are over, I'm going to give the first spot on my &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/">tabbed river&amp;lt;/a> to Apple, because 1. There are a lot of Apple fans, 2. There isn't yet a good river of Apple news, and 3. There's a big announcement coming, apparently in September. A good time to develop the flow of news about Apple.	Here are the feeds I have so far.		9to5Mac		AppleInsider		Ars Technica Infinite Loop		CNET News - Apple		Daring Fireball		Gizmodo: Apple		inessential.com		MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories		Marco.org		NYT > Apple Incorporated		Technology: Apple | guardian.co.uk		The Verge -  Apple Posts		TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog	If you have others to suggest please post links to the feed in a comment below. 	PS: Thanks to Marco Arment for sharing his links via email. Is the Twitter API an open standard?	I don't think Twitter considers its API to be proprietary. There have been numerous clones and as far as I know they've never said anything about it. 	I am, of course, not a lawyer and am not seeking a legal answer. The question is, if one were to compete with Twitter and if the API is an important part of the competitive product, why wouldn't you seek total interop with Twitter? That way developers are not in any way locked in to either platform. 	I'm not telling anyone what to do, or making any moral judgements, just coffee-housing, kibitzing, pontificating, hopefully harmlessly. :-)Preview: Tabbed river	I have four rivers that I follow pretty much all day while I'm working.	Olympics, tech news, my own personal interests, and New Orleans. I want to be systematic about keeping up with each of these rivers, so I put into tabs on this page:	&amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/">http://tabs.mediahackers.org/&amp;lt;/a>	The Olympics will be intensely interesting for another week or so. Tech news is something I'm always interested in. The tech tab here comes from the feeds in TechMeme's leaderboard. The 100 most frequently cited news sources for the previous 30 days. 	New Orleans is interesting because their newspaper, the Times-Picayune, announced that is curtailing printing. I wondered if some of the slack could be picked up by a river of news. 	If you have any questions about how this is done, please post a comment here.	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;no-icons>false&amp;lt;/no-icons>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	Update -- added a feature that allows you to select the active tab from the URL. Useful if you're bookmarking the river and know which one is most important to you.		&amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=nola">http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=nola&amp;lt;/a>		&amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=olympics">http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=olympics&amp;lt;/a>		&amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=tech">http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=tech&amp;lt;/a>		&amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave">http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave&amp;lt;/a>	It also handles the case where you specify a panel that doesn't exist. 		&amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=doesnotexist">http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=doesnotexist&amp;lt;/a>	Another update -- I added the Berkman river. 		&amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=berkman">http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=berkman&amp;lt;/a>Tabbed rivers question	I want to put multiple rivers on one page using a tabbed interface.	Here's an &amp;lt;a href="http://tabbedblogposts.blorkmark.com/">example&amp;lt;/a> of the tabs. And here are &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.scripting.com/august2012/8312ByDw/riverExamples">three rivers&amp;lt;/a>. When I &amp;lt;a href="http://2945.mediahackers.org/tabbedRivers">try&amp;lt;/a> to concatenate the rivers, the Javascript code gets (understandably) confused. I admit that as a JS programmer I am in way over my head. But as a user, I know exactly what I want.	How to do it! (Any help is much appreciated.)	&amp;lt;i>Update: I have the answer, thanks to Kashif Khan's help. I'll post a demo shortly. :-)&amp;lt;/i>What if Feedburner closes?	A bunch of people sent me links to this &amp;lt;a href="http://thewayoftheweb.net/2012/08/is-feedburner-about-to-be-closed-by-google/">piece&amp;lt;/a> that asks if Feedburner is about to be closed by Google. My guess is that Feedburner is probably not closing now. It sounds like they're shutting down some communication channels they weren't using, and pulling back from a business model that wasn't making money.	But what if they &amp;lt;i>are&amp;lt;/i> shutting down Feedburner? This is something you should think about. Google people give me grief when ever I mention that it might not be the best idea for people to centralize their feeds this way. And they're entitled to their point of view, but I'm pretty sure I'm right about this one. It wasn't a very good idea. The fact that Google is pulling back from the service, and that is unquestionable, is evidence of that. 	What can you do, and what can Google do to make a transition easier?	1. Google can use the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301">redirection&amp;lt;/a> facilities built into the web to send traffic to the Feedburner version of your feed back to its original location. That way people can keep publishing their feed contents and the subscribers will continue to receive updates. It's crucial that the connection between publishers and subscribers be preserved.	2. You can use the &amp;lt;a href="http://support.google.com/feedburner/answer/79586/">facility&amp;lt;/a> that Google provides to map a CNAME to your feed, so that if Google shuts down Feedburner, you can point that name at your main server, and your feed could continue to be accessed even if Google does not provide a redirect.	If you have any questions, post them here. If I can't answer them I'll try to find the answer.Digg archive gone?	Worth noting, a &amp;lt;a href="http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2012/08/digg_betaworks.php">SF Weekly article&amp;lt;/a>  that says that the Digg archive is gone.  	If this is true, then the value of Digg as a way of preserving the history of its time is nil. 	I read the &amp;lt;a href="http://digg.com/faq">FAQ&amp;lt;/a> that explains they're providing users with their data. 	This connects back to the &amp;lt;a href="http://threads.scripting.com/72512ByDw/dearFredSecondAttempt">question&amp;lt;/a> I asked Fred Wilson last week. In Madison, August 22 and 23	A heads up for people in Wisconsin who read Scripting News.	I will be in Madison on August 22 and 23, participating in the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.ftf2012.com/">Forward Technology&amp;lt;/a> conference, and getting another look at the town I went to school in in the late 70s. 	We're going to have a meetup at the Computer Science building on &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=1210+W.+Dayton+St,+madison+wi&amp;hl=en&amp;hnear=1210+W+Dayton+St,+Madison,+Wisconsin+53715&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;z=16">Dayton St&amp;lt;/a> across from Union South on the evening of the 23rd, 5PM to 8PM.	Andrew Shell is orchestrating from the Madison side of things. &lt;/pre>December 2012 = &lt;pre>My tech new years resolution	A friend who is a &amp;lt;a href="http://betabeat.com/2012/12/think-before-including-emoji-in-every-text-nyc-techies-new-years-resolutions/">reporter&amp;lt;/a> sent an email saying they're looking for New Year resolutions from people in NY and in tech. Arrgh, I groaned out loud. I'll never come up with anything. So I put it out of my mind.	Then trolling Twitter thinking about doing something fun with a couple of hours free time this morning, I came across a &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/285761435714342913">tweet&amp;lt;/a> from Paul Ford, a New York tech guy who also happens to be an excellent &amp;lt;a href="http://nymag.com/author/paul%20ford/">published&amp;lt;/a> writer. He also makes a living writing docs about XML and scripting, and other technical topics. He occupies a unique cell in my brain. A techie who is also literate. 	Every time his &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain">name&amp;lt;/a> pops up in my feed I think -- Man I wish there was a project I could do with this guy. Then I thought back to the question my reporter friend asked. And I had my opportunity.	Thus, my resolution for the New Year is: I will do what I can to make tech writing more literate.What is Silicon Valley?	&amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/siliconValleyIsWrongAboutCollege">Silicon Valley&amp;lt;/a> is an idea that represents an industry, analogous to Hollywood, Wall Street, MSM, academia. 	Sometimes these concepts are geographic, sometimes the geography is totally symbolic. For example, there are people who are definitely part of Silicon Valley who live and work in New York. And there are people in New York also who are part of Hollywood. 	Saying Silicon Valley thinks college is a waste is like saying Hollywood is fighting piracy. Or Wall Street supported Romney in 2012.  Believe it or not I am part of Silicon Valley, and I sure don't agree with the idea that college is irrelevant, so it's not an absolute or unanimous thing.	We say things like this all the time, often to explain what we don't agree with. It doesn't make sense to spend a few paragraphs stating exactly what all the people in tech think in all its variants. Even if &amp;lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4986693">Paul Graham&amp;lt;/a> hasn't heard that Silicon Valley thinks college is a waste, the students have. I went to his &amp;lt;a href="http://startupschool.org/">Startup School&amp;lt;/a> and &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/october/ii">talked&amp;lt;/a> with a few of them. I worked at NYU for a couple of years, and saw all the energy drawing students out of school and into startups. That pull totally came from tech. The students hear it even if Peter Thiel is saying something subtly different.	So that's what I wanted to respond to. And I think I wrote a pretty good &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/siliconValleyIsWrongAboutCollege">essay&amp;lt;/a>. It's certainly resonated with a few people (except in PG's backyard). I believe there's something there. Silicon Valley is wrong about college	Lately I've been thinking a lot about startup culture, and am reminded of its nobility -- having started three companies in my career, and learned from each experience, and even occasionally made some money. I'm more positive on startups these days than I have been in a while. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/30/arrows.gif" width="145" height="143" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named arrows.gif">I have experience as an entrepreneur, but I also have an education. For me, it was a rough path. I dropped out, briefly, in high school. Got a chance to reboot my education, which was something I really needed to do. I had a professor in my freshman year of college who showed me that my mind could do math. And from there, I took charge. With mixed results. But at the end of the mess, I &amp;lt;i>was&amp;lt;/i> educated. Not just in science and technology, but also in art, music, history, economics and literature. There were a few things I wish they had required I learn: accounting and psychology, foremost, so I wouldn't have been so scared of taxes and sex. But on the whole I think I got a pretty good deal. 	Nowadays &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/whatIsSiliconValley">Silicon Valley&amp;lt;/a> says that college education is a waste. This idea has spread to academia too. They're trying to make the experience more relevant to entrepreneurs and their investors. I've heard it &amp;lt;a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/1/27/experiment-fund-seas-investment/">said&amp;lt;/a> at Harvard that they want to participate in the success of the next Gates and Zuckerberg, both Harvard dropouts. I find this disturbing. I want them to educate better citizens, not richer business people. If they happen to be better citizens and rich, all the better. But first comes the person, not the bank account.	I don't think Gates and Zuckerberg are good role models for young people. And not just because they dropped out. It's more subtle. Most kids who try to be the next billionaire entrepreneur will fail. There probably isn't even &amp;lt;i>one&amp;lt;/i> such success in the class of 2013. So most will be disappointed. And if we push the kids toward that, we will lead them to believe, mistakenly, that it's enough to create a massive fortune. It is not enough. And if they fail to create the fortune, according to this standard, they will have failed in life. So, not only will we have set this generation up to fail, but we have just certified the mistake of past generations, that wealth itself has meaning. It has a lot less meaning, imho, than most people think. 	When you look at the problems our democracy has, probably the biggest one is the "low information voter." The ignorant electorate that says they want government out of our lives, but keep your hands off Medicare and Social Security, for example. We should strive not to create better billionaires, we should set our sights higher -- to create better voters. I'm not saying they should vote the way I want them to. I don't vote the same way I did 20 years ago. We should however vote with a purpose. Not for style or appearance. For what's good for ourselves and for the country. 	The education process could work better, so let's make it work better. But before you throw it out, think clearly and seriously about what we depend on it for. 	Update: There's a Hacker News &amp;lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4986494">thread&amp;lt;/a> on this piece.Two-minutes on Promised Land	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/29/promisedLandPoster.gif">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/29/posterNarrow.gif" width="125" height="185" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named posterNarrow.gif">&amp;lt;/a>What could be bad about a &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promised_Land_(2012_film)">movie&amp;lt;/a> starring &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Damon">Matt Damon&amp;lt;/a> and &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_McDormand">Frances McDormand&amp;lt;/a>, that was written by Damon and directed by &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Van_Sant">Gus Van Sant&amp;lt;/a>?

In other words they couldn't even get the standard plot right. 		The plot: Corporate asshole falls in love, finds he has a conscience, struggles, decides to do the right thing, gets the girl. 		The plot: &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Maguire">Jerry Maguire&amp;lt;/a>, which I really loved, however with none of its charm, or coherence. Or &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e_Zellweger">Renee&amp;lt;/a> or &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba_Gooding,_Jr.">Cuba&amp;lt;/a>. :-)	However, this time the &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=promised+land+reviews">reviewers&amp;lt;/a> got it right. 	I don't understand how a movie can suck as much as this one did.	They had a great idea -- let's expose &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing">fracking&amp;lt;/a> -- something that's very important. That, and $9 billion corporations suck the life out of people and communities. And if you want to show us how, great -- but they didn't.	There were two people conversing loudly during the coming attractions, and I was thinking Oh this is going to suck. After the first half hour of the movie I thought they were more interesting than the movie.	My eyes were rolling so often I just decided it would be simpler to leave them permanently rolled. They are rolled right now in fact.	In case it isn't completely obvious: Skip this one. 	PS: It did have a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/29/promisedLandPoster.gif">great poster&amp;lt;/a>. Probably why I was suckered into seeing the movie.Amazon and static sites	According to a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2012/12/root-domain-amazon-s3-website.html">post&amp;lt;/a> late last night by Werner Vogels, CTO at Amazon, and an &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/28/emailFromAws.gif">email&amp;lt;/a> they sent to all AWS users just now, and a &amp;lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html?ref_=pe_12300_27532130">walkthrough&amp;lt;/a> on the AWS site, they appear to have finished the implementation of static websites on S3. I'm going to check that out right now and report back.	The problem was in the past you could only map a CNAME to a bucket, not the domain itself. This is because of a limit in the DNS system. They appear to have implemented a non-standard (and appreciated!) alias feature in their Route 53 DNS service, which many of us use. 	What's not clear in the docs is if a request from mydomain.com is 		1. Redirected to www.mydomain.com or 		2. If the user of your site simply sees the content as residing at mydomain.com.	To some this may seem picky, but I won't be using the feature if it's #1, because I think it's just plain wrong to waste four characters at the beginning of a web URL. I'm a member of the &amp;lt;a href="http://no-www.org/">No-WWW&amp;lt;/a> movement. I would rather pay the extra money for a host than have readers of scripting.com be redirected to www.scripting.com. However if the distinction is tranparent to users, then I'll use it, but hope that next year they get rid of this limit. 	Cliff Notes version of the walkthrough		Their walkthrough is very verbose. I'm going to do the Cliff Notes version here. 		1. Register a domain and set it up so it's managed by Route 53. For my demo, the domain is &amp;lt;a href="http://bloatware.org">bloatware.org&amp;lt;/a>. It's a real domain, with a placeholder home page currently being served by other software. If this goes well it will be hosted in an S3 bucket.		2. Create an S3 bucket for the domain. &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/28/createBloatware.gif">Screen shot&amp;lt;/a>.		3. Upload the website. In this case, I just have an index.html file with an image on it. &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/28/indexHtml.gif">Screen shot&amp;lt;/a>.		4. You have to add a "bucket policy." Follow the instructions in step 4 of this &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/03/08/howToUseTheHostawebsiteFea.html">howto&amp;lt;/a> I did a couple of years ago. 		5. Next, configure your bucket for website hosting. Click on its name in the left panel, and then click on Properties at the top of the right panel, and then Static Website Hosting below that in the right panel. You should get a display that looks like this &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/28/staticWebsiteHosting.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a>. Important, copy the endpoint because you'll probably need it in the next step. (We hope.)			bloatware.org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com		6. Finally, go to Route 53, and set it up so it's hosting your domain. For that you can refer to the Amazon docs. But the key new feature is the ability to make the root name a CNAME that's an alias. I just &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/28/aliasSetup.gif">guessed&amp;lt;/a> how to do it (the docs are too complex to follow) and it worked! Hey they did it right. Yehi. ;-)	Postscript		They did it the right way, #2 above. I can host scripting.com in a bucket and the user will not see www.scripting.com. You can redirect from www.scripting.com to scripting.com any way you wish, you don't have to use Amazon's method. That's why the docs are so confusing, they assume you need to use their software to do the redirect. 	One more thing		Now that they have this wonderful feature, it would be nice if they increased the per-user limit on buckets from 100 to something more reasonable, perhaps 10000. :-)		Or maybe no limit at all. It would be great to set up a hosting service based on this feature, and the arcane process of setting it up. It could be very useful, for example, to Dropbox users. But with a limit on the number of buckets, and buckets being the basic unit of this feature, it's impossible to set such a service up.		Gives Werner something to ask for &amp;lt;i>next&amp;lt;/i> year? :-)Blogger of the Year -- 2012	This is something I do at the end of every year, at least for the last five years or so. 	I try to pick one person who exemplifies the blogging spirit, which is a multi-faceted thing. So each year there's been one face we take a look at. In the past we've looked at &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/2002/01.html#bloggerOfTheYear2001">Joel Spolsky&amp;lt;/a>, &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/24/bloggerOfTheYear.html">NakedJen&amp;lt;/a>, &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2008/12/24/bloggerOfTheYear.html">Jay Rosen&amp;lt;/a>, &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/12/31/bloggerOfTheYear.html">Julian Assange&amp;lt;/a> and &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/31/bloggerOfTheYear.html">Seth Godin&amp;lt;/a>. 	These days I start thinking about BOTY in the summer. I know no one is waiting to hear who won, but it's an important process for me, because it helps me understand what blogging is and isn't. And this year's decision came down to two people, and in the decision is some truth about what blogging is, I hope.	First, I thought it should be Nate Silver, who is most certainly a blogger, even though his writing now appears on nytimes.com. I thought it would be a good idea to say that blogging can take place even at a famous newspaper, even by someone who is paid to blog. Blogging isn't always an &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur">amateur&amp;lt;/a> thing, even though I strongly associate the word with the deed. Amateur means it's done for love, not money. Good blogging &amp;lt;i>is&amp;lt;/i> amateur. But then so is good everything, pretty much. I don't really care how much money you made writing that book or movie script. I care about what it evoked for me, what you said, what it proved. On those grounds Nate Silver certainly belongs in the BOTY seat for this year. He proved that an individual with his brain and beliefs can conquer all the paid pundits the pros can muster. Politically and spiritually Nate is a carrier of The Cause. Believe your eyes and ears, and your mind, not conventional wisdom. But in the end, I believe his accomplishments in 2012 were not about his blogging. The blogging was a means to a different end. If there's an award for statistical modeler of the year, that award should go to Nate, without contest.	&amp;lt;a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/27/philipAndAlex.jpg" width="115" height="135" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named philipAndAlex.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>My choice for BOTY is someone you might not have heard of, unless you were a techie in the early days of the web. If so, then you &amp;lt;a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/">defintely&amp;lt;/a> know &amp;lt;a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/">Philip Greenspun&amp;lt;/a>. He was a blogger before there were blogs, writing his own web CMS so he could tell the &amp;lt;a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/">stories&amp;lt;/a> of his photography, flying, his beautiful dog, teaching at MIT, and his startup. It was when he wrote about the startup that he caught my &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/24/got15Minutes.html">attention&amp;lt;/a>. I remember reading the &amp;lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010429095927/http://philip.greenspun.com/arsdigita/litigation-story">story&amp;lt;/a> of the people, his mistakes with investors, what he learned. Oh man, this guy is a blogger, for sure! But he wasn't writing on an official blog. Yet.		&amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/24/got15Minutes.html">At the time I said&amp;lt;/a>: "I think we're really onto something here. The people are doing their own press, and doing it damned well. Thanks to Philip Greenspun for showing us how it's done, and thanks for the courage to state your case so clearly. Amateur journalism at its best."	That came later when we started a blogging server at Berkman Center in 2003. It was probably at one of his Sunday afternoon parties in his Cambridge apartment when I said he should get a blog on our server. He did, and it's &amp;lt;a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/">still there&amp;lt;/a>, and he's still writing. And it's great stuff. When a Greenspun post appears in my &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave">river&amp;lt;/a>, I post it to my &amp;lt;a href="http://links.scripting.com/">linkblog&amp;lt;/a> to be sure I read it. His politics and mine are almost 180 degrees opposed, but he's still a read, because you can see how a brilliant mind can take the same facts, and get to a totally different destination. And when it comes to aviation, or any of the practical subjects he writes about, there's always a lot of wisdom, and entertainment, in a Greenspun post.	This is what I meant by the &amp;lt;a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html">unedited voice of a person&amp;lt;/a>. That's what a blog is. That's all you have to do to be a blogger. But to be a great blogger, you must have something to say. That's Greenspun, for sure.Reporting weather news	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/4346125293/in/set-72157623274784085/lightbox/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/26/storm.jpg" width="165" height="93" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named storm.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>Someone should report weather news the way other news is reported.	I said this in a variety of ways on Twitter yesterday, as a blizzard was working its way through the midwestern US, and got back pointers to regional feeds. I could follow the weather in the midwest. Yes, I knew that. I already follow the weather for NYC, and for a few other parts of the country, but I'm looking for something different. 	An example. The NYT has a feed for International News. One for Sports News. One for baseball and one for basketball. But they don't seem to have one for weather. The basketball feed has news about basketball where ever it happens. Not just for the NY-area teams. I would like to follow weather the same way. Yes, I have a particular interest in some areas. But I have a general interest in weather. 	There are probably other areas that we're not covering very well from a news standpoint, but right now weather seems to be the most glaring. Yes I know about wunderground.com. It's not what I'm talking about. It's reallly simple. News. About. Weather. No matter where it happens.	It should be written like news, not like a meteorologist's report. I am not a meteorologist. 	You'd think weather.com would do this, but they don't. Heat-seeking missiles	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/25/missile.gif" width="95" height="432" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named missile.gif">As someone who enjoys walking in New York, as many NYers do, I thought to take a walk relatively early yesterday. It was crisp, in the low 30s. Not windy. And it's Christmas Eve so I figured the sidewalks would be pretty empty. They were. However, that didn't mean that people talking on phones or reading/sending texts were paying any more attention than usual. If anything, they took license to occupy even more of the sidewalk. 	They can be pretty difficult to avoid. I think this is because we have an inner mechanism that draws us to other people. Or maybe it's my personal energy. I'm walking toward someone whose eyes are looking into their device. I move a little to the left, they move to their right. Okay, let's try it the other way. No luck, they match my move. I end up stopping a foot in front of them as they walk into me. I don't want anyone to say that I walked into them. They're usually not pissed. I guess they're accustomed to finding themselves in this position?	I'm old fashioned. When I want to check for messages on one of my many devices (doesn't matter which, they're all synched), I generally pull off to the side and stop. In winter, I have to take off my gloves. And I'm just not fast or agile enough (fat fingers, fuzzy vision) to do this while walking. I'm also afraid that I'll end up walking into a city bus, which might have a rude effect on my future existence. :-)	A story I've told many times. I lived in Florida for a few months in 2005. I wanted to try living on the beach, and I had family in the area, so this made sense as a place to try out. In this part of Florida, you can drive on the beach, which goes for miles, between inlets on the intercoastal waterway. This stretch of beach was about 10 miles long, and except for a &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=crescent+beach,+fl&amp;ll=29.745302,-81.254883&amp;spn=0.301663,0.268822&amp;hnear=Crescent+Beach,+St+Johns,+Florida&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;z=12">town&amp;lt;/a> in the middle of it, mostly empty. One morning I decided to take my swim via car. I drove a couple of miles south, on a stretch of beach that was totally empty. I laid out the towel, read for a while, then went for my swim. When I came back, there was another car parked next to mine. The people were gone, so I couldn't ask them why they chose that spot, when there were so many other places to stop that were totally secluded.		&amp;lt;iframe width="600" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=crescent+beach,+fl&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Crescent+Beach,+St+Johns,+Florida&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;ll=29.768848,-81.25351&amp;amp;spn=0.104306,0.205994&amp;amp;z=12&amp;amp;iwloc=A&amp;amp;output=embed">&amp;lt;/iframe>&amp;lt;br />&amp;lt;small>&amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=crescent+beach,+fl&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Crescent+Beach,+St+Johns,+Florida&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;ll=29.768848,-81.25351&amp;amp;spn=0.104306,0.205994&amp;amp;z=12&amp;amp;iwloc=A&amp;amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">View Larger Map&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;/small>	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/25/magazine.gif" width="154" height="182" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named magazine.gif">Yes I am old fashioned. I still think it's hilarious to see a person walking down the street talking to no one. Hands waving wildly.

"David, vat ist dis?" he might have asked.	When you get the idea that things will always be the way they are now, remember that not long ago people thought there was something special about &amp;lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/25/newsweek/">printed magazines&amp;lt;/a>. Then go look at a magazine rack, if you can find one. Someday, not too many years from now, you'll mention the idea of a printed magazine, and a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXV-yaFmQNk">young person&amp;lt;/a> will have no idea what you're talking about. How to make a smiley	I was talking with a friend who is a computer-using newbie who didn't know how to make a smiley. 	Don't laugh. :-)	Here's how you do it.	colon hyphen right-paren	That's all there is to it.	Unlike most things to do with computers, this one is &amp;lt;i>easy.&amp;lt;/i> :-)Limits on HTML email?	I was chatting with a friend the other day about using my outliner to write email, and later it struck me, why not?	So I wrote a script that took an outline and rendered it as if it were on a web page and then emailed it to myself.	When I opened it in GMail, not surprisingly, all the text was there, but the Javascript and most of the CSS had apparently been stripped. 	This led me to wonder if there's anything like a standard or best-practices document that says what email clients typically do with emails that have script and style?	BTW, here's the &amp;lt;a href="http:///static.scripting.com/misc/emailtest.html">text I actually sent&amp;lt;/a>, and a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/23/htmlemail.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a> of the email.

But many people push it away. It's too heavy to really contemplate. We all have problems in our own lives, things to worry about on a much smaller scale, to really be able to incorporate the kinds of changes such disasters will bring about into our thinking.	With that as background, I highly recommend reading this &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/science/earth/west-antarctica-warming-faster-than-thought-study-finds.html?_r=0&amp;emc=rss&amp;partner=rss">article&amp;lt;/a> in the NY Times about what's happening in the Antarctic. NBA All-star picks	Pick#1: Omer Asik - Houston Rockets 	Pick#2: Kevin Durant - Oklahoma City Thunder 	Pick#3: Chandler Parsons - Houston Rockets 	Pick#4: James Harden - Houston Rockets 	Pick#5: Jeremy Lin - Houston Rockets 	Pick#6: Carmelo Anthony - New York Knicks 	Pick#7: LeBron James - Miami Heat 	Pick#8: Tyson Chandler - New York Knicks 	Pick#9: Deron Williams - Brooklyn Nets 	Pick#10: Raymond Felton - New York Knicks 	You can &amp;lt;a href="http://allstarballot.nba.com/daily?referrer=asb12_reg&amp;cid=asb12_reg">vote&amp;lt;/a> too. :-)The easy stuff should be easy	Anyone who's trying to create a platform should keep this in their mind when making decisions about which way to go. The point of making a platform is to encapsulate something that you've finally figured out how to simplify. Then you put the complex stuff behind an interface, and it becomes easy. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/22/crane.gif" width="135" height="179" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named crane.gif">I like to visualize a very huge ball at the end of a very long chain. I have it between my index finger and thumb, and with the least effort possible I should be able to make the ball swing as fast as I want in exactly the direction I want it to go. That's my idea of power. 	There's a huge opportunity to simplify now that the web browser is being used as an application environment. We're pushing the envelope now further than we did in the age of desktop applications. But we've already simplified that once before, as the desktop platform matured. So I don't have any doubt that the simplification of the browser programming environment is coming. It will happen because it &amp;lt;i>is&amp;lt;/i> happening. ;-)	Things we need all the time are getting simplified, factored -- and standards are emerging. &amp;lt;a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery&amp;lt;/a>, for sure that's a standard. And more and more so is &amp;lt;a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap Toolkit&amp;lt;/a>. But it can get simplified further. What we're doing now is exactly what we did in the early-mid 80s as we went from character-based apps to graphic apps. We know how to simplify here. And Bootstrap is very much on the path.	When I build in Bootstrap I have to worry much less about whether it will run in all browsers. And browser-makers should be sure they don't break Bootstrap apps or jQuery apps. The platform is being elevated. And the stuff that should be easy is &amp;lt;i>becoming&amp;lt;/i> easy. My 3-minute review of Lion	I got my new iMac on Monday, and immediately switched out the old one after doing the hot-copy upgrade, which is fantastic. Probably the nicest thing that Apple does. Of course it makes it easier for you to give them money too, but wtf. 	&amp;lt;rules (blogSectionsRules)>	Okay, first the good stuff: 		It is really fast. This is important because I like to run a lot of &amp;lt;a href="http://bloatware.org/">bloatware&amp;lt;/a>, concurrently. More speed is goodness. It means I can keep more balls in the air. 		It's more beautiful. The screen is brighter, clearer, just qualitatively superior to the previous iMac.	Now the glitches:		They keep moving parts that shouldn't move. 		They keep changing the plugs in the back. So old devices stop working because there's no more Firewire on the thing, for example. 		The keyboard has the Control key in a different place. This meant that for the first few days I can't type quickly, everything has to slow. down. so. I. can. be. sure. my. fingers. are properly. positioned. over. the. right. keys. Try typing with a period after every word and you'll get a good idea what the re-learning experience is like. And what will it be like when I go back to the MacBook Air, which I still use when traveling? I'll let you know.		A few pieces of software I depend on required upgrades to run on the new OS. One of them wasn't free, VMWare, which charged $45 for the upgrade. Not sure if I get any features I need for this, but it does work on the new OS.	And the travesty:		&amp;lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30575/30575-h/30575-h.htm">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/21/guitar.gif" width="95" height="200" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named guitar.gif">&amp;lt;/a>They fucking changed the way fucking scrollbars work. That would be a glitch. But the travesty is that there are things you can't do on the new scrollbars that you can do on the old ones. 		I am a serious professional computer user. This would be like Fender moving around the frets on a &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Telecaster">Telecaster&amp;lt;/a>. Or the knob that adjusts the pitch of one of the strings.

People would put up stories that were intended to fool readers into believe something that wasn't true. I did it once or twice myself, but came to believe it was a bad idea. Instead I celebrated the birth of my blog on that day. It gave me an excuse to not participate.	Here's how I see it. One of two things happens:		1. Your prank is obvious, no one is fooled. Or		2. You pull it off. People are fooled into believing you. 	You lose in either case. In #1 obviously you look bad. And in #2, you convince people you most want to trust you, to not trust you. It's like deliberate failure, on your mission. Analogously, it would be like a bus driver deliberately taking you somewhere that isn't on his route. Or a street cleaner dumping garbage on the street. Or a teacher telling you something he or she knows is false. It's not just bad, it's very bad. It undermines what you do. 	This came up today when a blogger who I've followed on Twitter for a long time posted an item saying that Twitter had added the ability to edit a tweet. It looked like he was reporting a news event that's very significant. And since he covers Twitter itself, he's exactly the kind of guy I'd hope would break this big story. 	All kinds of thoughts ran through my head after I RTd it. Would the press credit him with the discovery? So often they don't recognize news until a big publication reports it. This guy is an individual blogger, but one who I respect. I hoped that he &amp;lt;i>would&amp;lt;/i> get credit. 	A couple of hours later, when I had a moment I looked around to see if anyone else was reporting it. I looked for the command to edit a tweet. Didn't find it. I guessed that they hadn't turned the feature on for me yet. This makes new Twitter features particularly confusing to report. You often have to try to interpret other people's view of the feature, if you weren't randomly chosen as one of the first to get the feature. 	I then responded to his tweet, &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/281789338013036544">asking&amp;lt;/a> where the feature was. I saw that others had responded the same. We all took his tweet at face value. Wanted to know more about it. One person &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vaibhav1981/status/281769073598160897">commented&amp;lt;/a> that Tweetbot would have to add the feature.	I then checked my DMs. There was a message there from him saying it was a joke, and he was sorry for the misunderstanding. 	BTW, apparently he deleted the original message, so I can't point to it. Twitter enables new apps	Something I haven't seen mentioned elsewhere.	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/19/tree.gif" width="125" height="172" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named tree.gif">The way Twitter packaged up the archives that people are starting to download enables new kinds of apps to be developed. That's because the data files are &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/letsExploreTwitterDownloads">distributed&amp;lt;/a> in a very software-readable format called &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON&amp;lt;/a>.	It will be possible to make all kinds of interesting tweet-browsers without hitting any rate limits, because you won't have to access twitter.com to get at all your tweets.	One thing they haven't said is how frequently they will allow people to download their archives. Once a week? Once a month? Or is it a one-time thing? 	But this is important. It will make a pretty substantial difference in the tech market, imho.	If I had &amp;lt;a href="http://www.geeksugar.com/Download-Twitter-History-26330019">access&amp;lt;/a> to my own archive I would start playing with this right away. Some people like to eat out	And some people like to cook for themselves.	And sometimes people who cook for themselves like to eat out, and vice versa.	So I &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews">use Flickr&amp;lt;/a> even though I could program my own photos site, and &amp;lt;a href="http://photos.scripting.com/2012/december">have&amp;lt;/a>. I find it convenient to use their front-end. But I don't have to. If I needed to cook my own meal, I would. I did.	Everyone always thinks the last turn of the cycle in tech was the first and the last time around the loop. It might be the last but it sure isn't the first. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/pollock/pollock.number-8.jpg">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/19/pollock.gif" width="145" height="116" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named pollock.gif">&amp;lt;/a>For Marc Andreessen, who Felix Salmon quotes in this &amp;lt;a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/12/18/how-capitalism-breaks-the-web/">piece&amp;lt;/a>, the first wave of the web was his first tech experience. And it made him a billionaire and launched a fantastic career as an investor and tech iconoclast. 	For me, it was my third time around the loop (I'm a generation older than Andreessen), but I didn't make nearly as much money as he did, nor was I trying to. For me, the web was creative liberation. Seriously. I had given up on making software because everything was so jammed up and ugly in the tech world. The web freed up everything. We could create again, because I could set up my own net that no one owned but me. I didn't have to get anyone's approval to play with servers. I needed that to be creative. 	Imagine if &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock">Jackson Pollock&amp;lt;/a> had to convince a big company that his art was worth making. That's why when everything is controlled by companies, we get stagnation. 	Being creative with tech is not for everyone, but so what. It mattered to me that I could be free. Obviously freedom doesn't matter to everyone. And it was and is available to anyone who wants it and had the patience to keep it going. 		And freedom matters to me in some activities and not in others. I feel no need to be free in creating new kinds of car engines. Or creating new paintings or works of music. There, I prefer the AOL/Facebook type of experience. I like going to art museums and Broadway plays, and to drive a fine car made by a big company I trust. But for me, I will always, till the day I die, want to run my own servers. Because that's where I choose to be creative. And if I let other people do it, there would be unacceptable limits on my creativity.		And I depend on the fact that people who create in other artisitic areas are free to do so. Who would want to see an endless stream of idiotic movies programmed for &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator">LCD&amp;lt;/a> intellect and emotional maturity. You see the problem, it &amp;lt;i>is&amp;lt;/i> possible for us to die as a culture. It's happened before. But the human spirit is pretty strong. And there will be someone forcing the question of how to create, as long as there are new ideas to explore. It's never been an easy sell that this kind of creativity applies to tech, but it does. 	If you've only seen one turn of the wheel, it must be hard to extrapolate that because there were turns before yours that it's likely there will be more to come. I don't have any trouble imagining it because I've seen it, I've lived it.	I don't say Andreessen is wrong, from his point of view the web never really was that wonderful. I accept his version of the truth, as his. But it's not mine. For me, the web was, and continues to be, liberating. 		We're all like the blind men and the elephant. Salmon sees the web as &amp;lt;a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/12/18/how-capitalism-breaks-the-web/">broken&amp;lt;/a>, as do the others he quotes. But I see it as liberating. We're all just reporting on the color of the lenses in our glasses. (And btw, all this discourse is happening on the web.)Instagram is for dummies	That's what the change in terms says.	If you're using Instagram and in any way care about your creative work, or what your word means, you're an idiot to keep using it.	Now, there &amp;lt;i>are&amp;lt;/i> a lot of idiots out there. 	Me, I always prefer to make tools for the smartest people.	Schnooks are welcome to use my competitors' products. :-)Elites in movie-going	Just a quick comment about all the discourse going on in the press about torture in the new movie &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=zero+dark+thirty">Zero Dark Thirty&amp;lt;/a>. It's very angering because I haven't seen the movie. Yet the pundits are discussing it, with lots of spoilers, in places where I can't miss it. 	Okay, I live in NYC and it's opening here tomorrow. For three days, and then it goes away. When will it come back? They don't say. I have a funny feeling it's only opening so it can be up for the awards for 2012. And the pundits go on talking about it as if the movie is available to everyone.	This system is going to end, hopefully soon. Let the movies open when they open, and everyone gets to see them at the same time. I don't think there's any special wisdom with the reviewers. They all liked a really shit movie, the latest Bond -- Skyfall. Why? It's so much better than the previous Bond film. Wow. That must have been one seriously awful movie. (I didn't see it.)	It's even more aggravating given the totally aggressive way Bigelow, the director of the movie, went after piracy for her last Oscar winner, Hurt Locker. On the other hand this movie is supposed to be seriously great. I'm going to see it tomorrow, even if I have to stand in a long line at the theater. Could we make Flickr into Twitter?	A thought just popped into my head when &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/99768838@N00/?relcreate=1">Peter Rojas&amp;lt;/a> friended me on Flickr.	I wondered what if we used &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr's API&amp;lt;/a> to implement a message system that worked like Twitter, with a timeline, and of course great picture support. Does the API have enough juice to do it? 	I think a lot of it would depend on how much of a moving target the API is. If it's not moving, at least for a couple of years, it might just work. 	I've said it &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/tryingTheNewFlickr">many&amp;lt;/a> &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/aNationalTreasure">times&amp;lt;/a> in the last few days, but it bears repeating. The thing that makes Flickr so interesting is its broad and stable API. Why is Twitter letting us export?	With all the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20767537">crazyness&amp;lt;/a> about Instagram and &amp;lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57559710-38/instagram-says-it-now-has-the-right-to-sell-your-photos/">how&amp;lt;/a> they &amp;lt;a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/what-instagrams-new-terms-of-service-mean-for-you/">own&amp;lt;/a> your pictures (not mine, I never used the service) it raises the question as to why Twitter is letting us export our tweets now? You don't see how they're connected? Read on...	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/18/blackHelicopter.gif" width="165" height="50" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named blackHelicopter.gif">Instagram's answer for those people who don't like it is this -- opt-out. You can download all your content, close your account, and we won't own anything. They're banking on the assumption that most people aren't paying attention, don't understand, or don't care if they use their picture of their beloved &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=beloved+aunt+amy">Aunt Amy&amp;lt;/a> to advertise a brand of cookies that caused her demise. There are some truly bizarre possibilities.	So maybe Twitter wants to use our pictures that way too -- esp since they now have access to all the pictures we post from other services, the ones who support the &amp;lt;a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards">Twitter Cards API&amp;lt;/a>. Which of course until last week included (tah dahh) Instagram.	The order in which things come public isn't necessarily the order they became known to the companies pulling the strings. It's quite possible Instagram gave Twitter a heads-up about the licensing change, and that Twitter told them to cut the cord, before dragging them into the mess. Or whatever. You just can't know what they're telling each other behind the scenes. 	So back to the question raised in the title. 	Maybe Twitter is letting us export because something bad is coming that they want to be able to offer an export-to-opt-out feature like the one Instagram is offering. A change in TOS that will be so unpalatable that if there was no way out, the FTC would stop the change (and rightly so).	Maybe it's just Twitter being good guys. Wanting us to feel good about them, and maybe even wanting to enable new applications, which the &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/letsExploreTwitterDownloads">JSON-based archive&amp;lt;/a> certainly does. Unless of course there are onerous licensing terms lurking in here somewhere. ;-)	One more thing. To publishers who act as if Twitter, Facebook, etc are part of the open Internet, maybe now you're getting the idea that this is not true. These are corporations who think and act just like you do. They are very likely future competitors of yours. And if you don't think of them that way, at least as a possibility, you stand to lose, big. Make Newtown a showcase?	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/us/lanza-used-a-popular-ar-15-style-rifle-in-newtown.html?pagewanted=all">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/17/bushmaster.gif" width="95" height="254" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named bushmaster.gif">&amp;lt;/a>According to this &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/nyregion/in-newtown-conn-a-stiff-resistance-to-gun-restrictions.html?pagewanted=all">NYT piece&amp;lt;/a>, &amp;lt;a href="http://goo.gl/maps/GdUq0">Newtown&amp;lt;/a> had a problem with guns before the tragedy. It would be interesting to see if they have any will to do anything about it, now that they have the first-hand experience of a nightmare of guns-gone-wild.	Also there's a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/newtown-sandy-hook-school-shooting/hc-newtown-schools-1218-20121217,0,5101421.story">question&amp;lt;/a> whether the &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=newtown+connecticut+sandy+hook+elementary+school&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=41.417493,-73.26591&amp;sspn=0.064558,0.085487&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=elementary+school&amp;hnear=Sandy+Hook,+Newtown,+Fairfield,+Connecticut&amp;t=m&amp;z=17">Sandy Hook&amp;lt;/a> school will re-open. Maybe it shouldn't. Maybe it should be turned into the National Gun Tragedy Museum. Re-create the horror scene, with dummies, fake blood, scattered body parts. Including the gunman. Everyone can come for a visit to see what guns do to the bodies of innocent school children, teachers, psychologists and school administrators.	Did anyone else notice that all the victims were women and children. What does that say about the honor of this country? (I'm sure they must have talked about that on TV, I have been avoiding the news the last few days, for the most part.)		Another thing I noticed that has nothing to do with this idea is that the school was named Sandy. What is going on here. Who is Sandy and why is he or she screwing around with the northeastern United States?	Maybe the thing to do is to confront the problem we have, whatever it is (no one knows, imho) and look at it straight-on. Instead of sweeping our feelings aside until the next horror comes along. 	Now, it's not my town, so it's not for me to say. But I don't think new laws will stop the escalating tragedies. They are getting worse. I don't want to enumerate the ways, but they are growing more frequent and more horrible.Bloated Republicans and Democrats	Last night I caught a bit of Meet the Press after the President spoke. I turned the sound off and watched for a few minutes. 	There was a bloated Republican dude talking aimlessly at a bloated Democrat. Neither of these guys held any offices. The Republican had been a secretary of something during the Reagan administration. 	I watched while I cleaned up after dinner. No sound. Just thought. All these guys do is opine for the cameras. Does anyone care what they think? I can't imagine why they would. But David Gregory asks them serious questions about which they have serious bullshit to say. I don't actually know what they say, because the sound is off. Maybe one them has something interesting to offer, but I'd be willing to give serious odds they don't.Sunday news is like opera	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/16/fatlady.gif" width="115" height="181" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named fatlady.gif">&amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/280326568889430017">A comment&amp;lt;/a> from Jay Rosen reminded me that Sunday news programs are so totally predictable. 	On each topic there are a fixed set of talking points. When a news event happens, the conductors -- Bob Schieffer, Chris Hayes, George Stephanopoulos, David Gregory, etc get out the script, and call in people to sing each role in the opera of the day. 	There's a male lead, a female lead, comic relief, someone to be murdered. All the usual characters. And they sing. If it's a big enough story, we just hear one opera per show. If it's a slow news week, we get a variety of songs. 	The only thing that's new from week to week is which operas are performed. Maybe a little stylistic variation. But always the same plot, and outcome.Let's explore Twitter downloads	According to &amp;lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/12/16/twitter-has-started-rolling-out-the-option-to-download-all-your-tweets/">Next Web&amp;lt;/a>, the new Twitter feature to download your history is now active for some people. 	It's not active yet for my account, but I'd still like to learn more about the format. So if it's available for your account, please consider sharing your archive with us techies so we can have a look inside.	If you have an archive, you can upload it somewhere or email it to dave dot winer at gmail dot com and I'll upload it so everyone can have a look. &amp;lt;i>Thanks!&amp;lt;/i>	Update: Thanks to &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shoppers_talk">Navjot Singh&amp;lt;/a>, we now have an archive to explore. 		Here's the &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/twitterArchives/navjot/README.txt">readme.txt&amp;lt;/a> file from Navjot's archive.		Here's the &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/twitterArchives/navjot/index.html">HTML view&amp;lt;/a> of the JSON archive.		An example of a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/twitterArchives/navjot/data/js/tweets/2012_10.js">JSON file&amp;lt;/a>, representing one month of tweets.		Here's the &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/twitterArchives/navjot/twitter.zip">compressed archive&amp;lt;/a>. The Flickr API is a national treasure	No joke, APIs are real, and are very important. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/15/sam.gif" width="145" height="195" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named sam.gif">And when a corporate vendor "deprecates" an API we've built on, it's really hard to shrug it off, esp since these changes usually modify the contract between developers and the platform. And it's very rare that the benefit accrues to the developers. Hey, very often when the API changes our apps are broken and gone, for good.	Recently new life has been pumped into Flickr by Yahoo, something us long-time users are surely glad to see. But -- with the new life comes concerns that the API will break. Because that's what big tech companies do when they move. 	It's particularly important with Flickr because it has been unmoving for so long, which usuallly has a big downside, but it has one huge upside. It means that &amp;lt;b>the API has been stable&amp;lt;/b>. Without breakage, we've been able to build some very good and useful systems on Flickr. Stuff Yahoo probably doesn't care about, but we &amp;lt;i>do&amp;lt;/i> care about it.	I was looking for a way to express that idea, and it hit me -- start a petition on &amp;lt;a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/declare-flickr-api-national-historic-landmark-requiring-it-be-maintained-yahoo-open-resource/9gR8kML5">whitehouse.gov&amp;lt;/a> to declare the Flickr API a National Historic Landmark. That's how neighborhoods in the physical world protect their character from corporate wrecking balls. If we didn't do this, the city where I live, New York, would have a freeway running down the middle of it. The East Village would only have NYU dorms. There would be no Central Park. And on and on. 	The founders of the city of New York were visionaries, and there's no reason we can't have vision for the future of the Internet. Let's make the revitalization of Flickr a complete win. Let's make sure Yahoo knows we want the API to remain stable, so we can continue to build on it as a platform. We think it's good business for them, but hey -- even if it isn't -- let's make sure our interests are represented here.	Let's do something constructive to save some of the DNA of the net. It's worth it.

The second one is starting to feel like spam. 		I'm guessing the people at Twitter don't understand how casual a follow is. I follow people I don't know. Last thing I want to do is "welcome them back." I have no idea where they went. Twitter is not for friends. That's Facebook. We need a way to opt out of this. Medium is moderated	I posted an item asking a question on Medium yesterday, but I received an email saying it was "not approved."	I'm not complaining, just sharing a bit of a data. It's a moderated system. Neither good nore bad. 	Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/15/mediumEmail.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a> of the email.	PS: To be clear, the item is &amp;lt;a href="https://medium.com/american-dreamers/cbd31ce61d99">still there&amp;lt;/a>, it's just no longer part of the collection. I assume this means there's no way to navigate to the item through the user interface of the medium.com site. The next web will grow faster	Ben Barren &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benbarren/status/279708101198893056">says&amp;lt;/a> something very smart on Twitter, that bears repeating and amplifying.	The podcasting boot-up in 2004 happened much faster than the blogging bootstrap for one simple reason. We already had blogging to carry the message. "Hey there's this new thing you should try!" 	Remember that when thinking about how high a barrier to entry the existing social silos have. How can they stop the message of their successor from propogating? Maybe they can. Better start thinking about it Dick and Zuck. :-)The message of the web	The message is simple and exciting. When the time is right, a very small number of people with a clear vision can build something with huge impact. I'm not talking about making huge numbers show up in their bank accounts. Access journalism is poison	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/14/hippieVan.gif" width="250" height="176" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named hippieVan.gif">Felix Salmon is a smart guy, a very good writer, so I recommend reading this &amp;lt;a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/12/14/the-transparent-dealbook-conference/">piece&amp;lt;/a> about what he calls "access journalism."	He's responding to Margaret Sullivan's &amp;lt;a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/13/dealbook-conference-was-impressive-lucrative-and-chummy/">piece&amp;lt;/a> in the NYT about the Dealbook conference that was a huge demo of access journalism. I didn't go to the conference (wasn't invited) and neither did Salmon. But we've both been to conferences like it. And while Salmon is a journalist who believes in access, I am a source and subject of journalism who despises it.		BTW, I'm friends &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/14/lance.gif">with&amp;lt;/a> Lance Knobel, who &amp;lt;a href="http://nytdealbookconference.com/contact.php">managed&amp;lt;/a> the program for the conference, as is Salmon (I believe). That's how I know Salmon. We met first at the Davos conference in 2000 where Knobel was the program director. I know Lance well, and know he's a realist about how these things work. However I speak for myself only. 		If I were playing by the rules of access journalism I would temper what I said about this conference, for fear of losing Lance his job, or losing influence with Lance. I thought this disclaimer made a good enough demo to include in this piece, though imho it wasn't necessary. 	In an earlier life, as a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, I was good at the access game. I traded ideas and news with reporters, and in return they wrote nice things about me and my product. I'm sure many of them actually liked our products, but the reason they looked at them, or even heard of them, was this exchange of favors. 	When you don't do this, they pretty much ignore you, or worse. I've had a fair number of very negative jobs done on me by the press after I gave up the favor-doing. I had become a blogger, had decided to route around the mess instead of trying to deal with it. I had good reasons for giving up, because when I tried to do something that was so ambitious that it tweaked my platform vendor, Apple, the press turned on me. All of a sudden my product didn't exist, I didn't exist. Crushed by the Great Company who in reality had shipped a vastly inferior product. Didn't matter. So we had to invent a different way to market. It's harder to go direct, but it's honest, and more satisfying. The people who control access to users through the press play a dirty nasty game. And many of them have business cards that say they're journalists.	I am glad that Sullivan has decided to challenge this corrupt mess, I felt it was very unlikely that she would. That's why I said she's the first public editor the Times has had. Becuase the previous public editors tried to dish up the mess in a recipe that's palatable to the journalists who are playing &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/14/footsie.jpg">footsie&amp;lt;/a> with the people they cover. 		&amp;lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&amp;lt;p>Margaret Sullivan is incredible. I just wanted to say that. A real public editor at the NYT, the first one imho.&amp;lt;a href="http://t.co/EygmD7ND" title="http://1vg.r2.ly/">1vg.r2.ly&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Dave Winer .&amp; (@davewiner) &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/279359767426768896" data-datetime="2012-12-13T22:58:53+00:00">December 13, 2012&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;/blockquote>		&amp;lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&amp;lt;/script>	Now, there's absolutely nothing wrong with having conferences like the Dealbook conference. But there's also nothing wrong with saying the truth about it, that the system it exposes yields inbred journalism. People who are close friends with the people they cover aren't really covering them. If that's all there is, then we aren't getting news. And that leads to huge problems. Open technologies are ignored because there's no marketing budget for them. Housing markets are turned into gambling casinos by people who already have more money than they could ever spend. Ordinary middle class people are turned out of their own homes. There are real consequences to this system. And global problems going unaddressed because the reporter didn't want to piss off some guy they use as a source.	We need &amp;lt;i>dozens&amp;lt;/i> of people working at the Times doing what Margaret Sullivan does. I think Andrew Ross Sorkin needs to feel the heat, he needs to feel pressure to stab his friends in the back when they do something awful, and we need to get Felix Salmon to use his intellect to expose their mediocrity, not defend their parties. 	Sullivan's piece marked a beginning, perhaps. I hope. 	A couple of postscripts.		1. My mother, a NYT daily reader for a long time, &amp;lt;a href="http://evespeeves.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/disappointed-in-the-new-york-times/">wrote&amp;lt;/a> on her blog that she might stop reading the Times because they weren't covering the Bradley Manning trial. She read about this in the Times itself in a Sullivan &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/public-editor/an-empty-seat-in-the-courtroom.html?_r=0">column&amp;lt;/a>. I said this is the reason to stay subscribed. That they now have the guts to &amp;lt;i>criticize themselves&amp;lt;/i> so openly is a very positive thing for the Times, and a first. They are bending just a little to the advent of the blog. There's hope. In the past we wouldn't have known they were doing this. Now we do.		2. I remember a column in PC Mag written in 1983 by &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norton">Peter Norton&amp;lt;/a>, who was fast becoming the go-to guy for technical information about the IBM PC which was booming. I had used his &amp;lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-IBM-PC-Peter-Norton/dp/0893035831">book&amp;lt;/a> to guide my implementation of &amp;lt;a href="http://outliners.scripting.com/thinkTank2Pc.html">ThinkTank&amp;lt;/a> for the PC. And I read every word in every one of his columns. In the previous column he had said that the new version of IBM PC DOS was awful. It didn't work. Crashed. Lost data. He was right. It &amp;lt;i>was&amp;lt;/i> awful. But he had gotten reprimanded by someone -- he didn't say who -- and he would never again question the wisdom of IBM. I thought it was remarkably honest of him to write this one last column. And true to his word, he never again challenged IBM. That was a very lonely moment. Up till then I felt like we were all in this together. Even IBM could benefit from honest criticism. That was the end of something important.The Internet as ecosystem	There are huge parallels betw the Internet and our planet. 	Open formats and protocols are like the DNA of endangered species. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/13/tryHarder.gif" width="145" height="141" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named tryHarder.gif">The proliferation of corporate networks is like the spreading of corporate everything from coffee to big box stores to airports. Sameness, lack of diversity, individuality withers. What makes life interesting fades away, conformity reigns.	But there still is art, even if most people don't live artisitc lives. And you can still use the open Internet even if most people don't.	Google owning Reader is bad for open stuff the same way it was bad that GM owned the public transit system of Los Angeles. It's like the fox guarding the hen house. Read the story in &amp;lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/robf4/googles-lost-social-network">Buzzfeed&amp;lt;/a> and see if the analogy holds.	It was strange reading Gruber's &amp;lt;a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2018607/the-unlikely-persistence-of-applescript.html">account&amp;lt;/a> of the evolution of system scripting on the Mac, because all the diversity that was present as it was evolving is gone from his story. As if it never happened. 	So the thing that matters on the net is choice. If you choose something &amp;lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/12/13/guardian-kills-its-facebook-social-reader-regains-control-over-its-content/">other&amp;lt;/a> than what everyone else is using, you're helping the net. You can still use the stuff everyone is using. But find a way to express yourself that's unique and that you know has value. And when you do that you're helping our intellectual and informational planet. And that probably can help the real planet too because if we're communicating and sharing ideas and information, we're better able to see problems, and perhaps find ways to solve them. 	Freaking out isn't going to help anything. Instead do the the opposite. Think, and act, and do something full of thought, for the Internet. Roll up your sleeves and do some good work.AppleScript was not alone	John Gruber has a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2018607/the-unlikely-persistence-of-applescript.html">piece&amp;lt;/a> in MacWorld about AppleScript in which he says that Open Scripting Architecture was supported only by Apple. That's not correct. 		&amp;lt;i>AppleScript was not originally intended to be the only OSA scripting language, but it was. The idea was that OSA was language-agnostic, and the plan was for there to be several of them eventually. AppleScript was the friendly language, derived from HyperCard's HyperTalk (therein another story entirely) and intended for use by non-programmers. The theory being that a programming language that looked like prose rather than code might enable a broad swath of 'non-programmers' to, well, program.&amp;lt;/i>	UserLand's Frontier scripting environment supported OSA, both as a client and a server. The syntax of our language, known as UserTalk, is most like &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python&amp;lt;/a> -- though it is a contemporary of Python, development started in 1988.	The OSA compatibility and the struggle with Apple to allow us to co-exist with AppleScript is well documented in the archive of Scripting News. 		&amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/beginning/applescript.html">Working With AppleScript&amp;lt;/a>: Shows how to run AppleScript code inside the Frontier environment.		&amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/snippets/userTalkEverywhere.html">UserTalk Everywhere&amp;lt;/a>: Frontier implements the Open Scripting Architecture, making it easy for scripting clients to hook up to the Frontier system.		&amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+applescript">A Google search&amp;lt;/a> for "AppleScript" on scripting.com.	Update: There's a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/JavaScriptOSA/">JavaScript&amp;lt;/a> OSA component too. The API makes Flickr great	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/12/glue.gif" width="114" height="271" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named glue.gif">Just read the &amp;lt;a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/flickr-has-the-opportunity-to-become-the-next-flickr/?seid=auto&amp;smid=tw-nytimesbits">review&amp;lt;/a> of the new Flickr mobile app from Nick Bilton at the NYT.	I'm a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/">Flickr user&amp;lt;/a> from the beginning, and I've stuck with it. 	I like Flickr for the API. It enables me to &amp;lt;a href="http://photos.scripting.com/2012/december">mirror&amp;lt;/a> everything I put up there on S3 which is really important to me. 	Hope they don't break the API. It's another of their big advantages, a huge base of compatible software. Lots of it hasn't been updated in a long time, all the more reason to leave it alone. (They've been talking about deprecating stuff for a long time, but my stuff still runs, which is good.)	Installed it on my iPod Touch . That's where I take most of my pictures.	It took me a few tries to remember the combination of username and password. Eventually got in.	Was able to browse my photos. Took a new photo of a couple of &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8268592462/in/photostream">soda cans&amp;lt;/a> on my desk. Used a filter to reduce the glare and give it an oldtime look. Not trying to demo the camera -- just want to see how the software works.	I'm glad they updated Flickr. It works. If more people use Flickr I'm happy. It's a mature photo service with tons of users and lots of photos, and a full API that I've built on. If it has a more assured future, I'm happy. 	But don't break my apps. Please. :-)An idea for a product	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/12/windowsPhone8.jpg" width="145" height="260" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named windowsPhone8.jpg">This is not a simple or obvious idea, so if you're skimming and expect to get it -- you probably won't. Just a caveat from someone who's accustomed to comments from people who aren't paying much attention. :-)	Anyway, here's a little background for motivation.	The last week I've been helping my very good friend NakedJen get started in the world of smartphones. Until now she had a Blackberry that could do SMS, but had email disabled. I don't really understand why, but it's not important to the story. She was hard to reach via email, and she couldn't use any of the apps we all like to use. She didn't have maps or any of the other cool stuff we're all playing with these days.	Once I understood where she was, I gave her a phone I wasn't using, one of the first Google Nexus phones. It was a gift from Google. So it was totally appropriate that I pass it on to NakedJen. 	I think she stayed up all night playing with the phone. When I checked in with her, she had done all kinds of customizations. The next day she was installing apps. She was giggling with glee at every revelation. I think she saw that this mode of computer use is actually pretty simple. And she's taking it back with her to Salt Lake City, where her family there will be very happy I'm sure that Jen will be part of the 21st Century (something I like to kid her about).	Next part of the story. This morning I got a Fedex from a longtime friend at Microsoft. In the package there were two new smartphones, a Nokia 920 and 810. Since I am a T-Mobile guy, I started with the 810. It's a lovely piece of tech. The performance and color are amazing. It's also very easy to guess where everything is. I had it set up to work over wifi with my GMail account in about five minutes. A few minutes later I was taking pictures and had installed the Twitter app. I sent a text message. Then we went out for a walk. I took my iPod Touch, iPad LTE and Nexus 4 with me, in addition to the 810, and of course NakedJen and her Android phone. It all worked just fine. Everything that didn't have its own service plan connected to the net via Bluetooth through the iPad. 	When we came back it was time for Jen to go home to Utah. She tried to get Glympse going but for some reason it didn't work, so I fell back to using text messages to follow her progress to La Guardia and her flight to Milwaukee. 	Now finally I'm able to explain the idea.	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8260477993/in/photostream/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/12/jenInNy.jpg" width="95" height="95" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named jenInNy.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>When I tried to send text messages from my desktop Mac, all of a sudden I was dropped into a horribly complex maze of things that make no sense. I can't even figure out how to send an SMS without someone sending me one first. I tried reading all of Google's docs, installed all the software they told me to install, and in the end I went back to the Nexus 4 to communicate with Jen. Later I realized I could do what I needed to with the Voice website. But there were problems there too. I ended up having to enter the number manually, my contacts list was useless in that context. 	The idea is this -- Google or Microsoft or Apple -- create a new app that runs on the desktop that's designed with the parameters of a smartphone. Leverage the skills I already have. I was able to set up the Windows Phone in a few minutes, on an OS that I had never used. I am a relatively expert Mac user, but failed after a half hour. The lesson is pretty clear. At the very least the desktop has to do what the mobile device does, with the same care of design and simplicity. What I'm left with is a hodgepodge of stuff that wasn't designed to do this. Time for a fresh look.More than a tweet, less than a post	There's a place for something between a tweet and a blog post. 	That's what I've been trying to explore here on the threads site. 	Quick little bits that wouldn't fit into 140 chars, and can benefit from having a place to comment with more than 140.	Maybe we need a name for this. Pweet?There are a lot of assholes out there	Re the Guardian profile of Julian Assange, which I &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/whatIsWrongWithTheGuardian">wrote about&amp;lt;/a> earlier today.	1. I'm sure the Guardian has profiled lots of assholes.	2. I'm also sure they don't make most the articles about what assholes they are.	3. How do they decide to make the story about what an asshole the person is?	My theory is that they do it if and only if other publications do. 	And of course if Barack Obama were a huge asshole they wouldn't make the story about that. Or Mitch McConnell (who surely is as abrasive as any public figure ever profiled) because to do so would show bias. It would not be balanced. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/08/admittingIt.gif" width="175" height="121" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named admittingIt.gif">That's how school kids decide who to bully, for example. If everyone makes someone their bitch, then it's okay for you to. So the Times runs a magazine profile about Assange's socks and other minutia, so the Guardian can find other scabs to pick at. Even if their readers might feel more than a little empathy for the guy. 	I wonder if their profiles of the Royal Family include this kind of stuff?	Would they interview the Queen the way they interview Assange?	In British culture is that even considered a reasonable question? 	Assange isn't a founder of Google. Doesn't control a huge budget. Isn't a military commander. He's broke and lives in exile &amp;lt;i>in a closet.&amp;lt;/i> He can't really do anything to you. He certainly can't pull his ads! :-)	Kicking someone when they're down is considered poor style in the US. A sign of cowardice. How about in Britain?Twitter copying Instagram	It's a shame that Twitter is &amp;lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20121208/twitter-aims-to-release-photo-filters-in-time-for-the-holidays/">copying&amp;lt;/a> the features of Instagram instead of giving us &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/twitterCouldDoSomethingNiceForUsers">features&amp;lt;/a> only Twitter can. The web is crying. :-(Central Park hawk	Came across this &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8256300956/in/photostream/lightbox/">hawk&amp;lt;/a> perched in a tree in Central Park today.	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8256300956/in/photostream/lightbox/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/08/hawk.jpg" width="500" height="669" border="0" alt="A picture named hawk.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>Twitter do something nice for users	Give us a way to delete a tweet from someone else in our Replies tab.	From time to time you get someone directing a speech at you, instead of to all their followers. They must have no idea how 20 messages from them look in someone else's Twitter equivalent of an inbox. 		It's lazy and inconsiderate. 			I went to the trouble to write my ideas in the form of a blog post. Where I could use full sentences, and not use cryptic abbreviations which are often impossible to decypher. I tried to link to my sources so you could see what I'm talking about if my prose was too dense. 		They're rants.			The rants you get in tweets often are not only full of vitriol, it's also impossible to tell what they're so excited about! 				As if I wanted to know. :-)	If it were email, you could just delete them, and that would be that. But in Twitter, they just stay there, until they scroll off. And that could take a long time.	Even the most interesting person gets longwinded communicating in 140-character chunk after chunk. And most of these tweets come from people who are angry, exhausted, highly opinionated, and not very respectful (or else they would realize how much of your space they're taking up).	It would be nice if we got one new simple user-oriented feature in Twitter in 2012. What is wrong with the Guardian?	For some reason I started to read a long &amp;lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/dec/07/julian-assange-fugitive-interview">news piece&amp;lt;/a> on Julian Assange on The Guardian website, and it was interesting, until the reporter started trashing Assange. I've included a brief excerpt below. 		&amp;lt;i>What about the fracture with close colleagues at WikiLeaks? "No!" he practically shouts. But Domscheit-Berg got so fed up with Assange that he quit, didn't he? "No, no, no, no, no. Domscheit-Berg had a minor role within WikiLeaks, and he was suspended by me on 25 August 2010. Suspended." Well, that's my point &amp;#173; here was somebody else with whom Assange fell out. "Be serious here! Seriously &amp;#173; my God. What we are talking about here in our work is the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people &amp;#173; hundreds of thousands &amp;#173; that we have exposed and documented. And your question is about, did we suspend someone back in 2010?" My point was that there is a theme of his relationships turning sour. "There is not!" he shouts.&amp;lt;/i>	The piece continues in this mode, mocking him, as if they were children. 	Assange stuck his neck out for all of us, and whether you agree with him or not, it doesn't matter whether you &amp;lt;i>like&amp;lt;/i> him. 	They need better editors at the Guardian, and more respect for their readers. Idea for a new democracy	This idea isn't for today's United States, but if we were to ever try to boot up a new democracy, I'd suggest thinking about only offering the vote to citizens who had served on a jury that reached a verdict. 	Then at least we'd get voters who understand how the government works. And maybe we'd actually get a government that tackles the real problems.	For example, we need a decision on climate change, and we needed to start implementing it 20 years ago, long before the effects could be felt by voters. 	Even now, when the entire NYC metropolitan area was shut down by Sandy, things are returning to normal, and we are deciding to postpone change for another year, until next year's miracle happens. Sandy, imho, is as ominous as the attacks of 9/11 were. 	Many things changed between 1776 and today. Instantaenous mass communication. Science appears to have conquered the elements. There's a sense that no matter what you see and hear and feel, that things can't really change that much.	But things have changed hugely in the last couple of hundred years. And we, for the most, feel these changes were positive. But that's changing now too. We've run out of frontier. We've run out of space. And we're more efficient at creating and sustaining human life. But that may be about to change (probably is) -- and we can't react until -- when? Not clear. 	If jurors were making the decisions, we'd suck it in, figure it out and do what needed to be done. That's what jury duty teaches you to do.Twitter and Instagram break up	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/05/webdead.gif" width="145" height="196" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named webdead.gif">Nick Bilton at the NYT &amp;lt;a href="http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/feed/">reports&amp;lt;/a> that Instagram removed their &amp;lt;a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards">Twitter cards&amp;lt;/a> metadata from their pages. This means that to view pictures taken by users in Instagram, you'll have to visit the Instagram site. 	Forgotten in the drama is: 1. Users and 2. the web. 	Having our pictures show up in Twitter isn't always the right thing. For example, when I link to a Flickr picture from a tweet, they take the picture from Flickr and show it directly in Twitter, without the reader having to visit the Flickr site. As a photographer, I would prefer this feature not be there, so people can comment on the pictures in Flickr, where there is no 140-character limit, and where the comments will have a relatively long period of visibilty. In Twitter they scroll off very quickly. 	I don't use Instagram, so I don't have an opinion about whether my (non-existent) Instagram pictures show up in Twitter.	I also think it's good for the web if there's separation between these websites. Twitter is rapidly becoming something bigger than the web, sort of a mega-web. That's not cool. The thing I liked about Twitter re Facebook is that it was a way of pointing people to other sites. Over time, they've stopped doing that so much. That has meant that we've only got 140 characters to play with. Some ideas require more than that. Only very simple ideas can be expressed in such limited space. 		&amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/2005/12/12.html#howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternetVersion3">2005&amp;lt;/a>: "People come back to places that send them away."	So it's not black and white. Not "Twitter Bad" or "Instagram Bad." Imho the only thing that's bad is the lack of diversity. These sites are growing too large, and we're growing too dependent on them. And as often happens in tech, the users and open standards become an afterthought to the warfare between large companies. But the good news is that this kind of fighting is a sign of an implosion coming soon, and a new period of expansion and innovation. When companies and the press become too focused on each other, and forget the users, the users seem to always break out, and invent a new layer. 	&amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gapingvoid/status/276369037934612480">Hugh MacLeod&amp;lt;/a>: "Billionaires squabbling about who gets to own the commons."	&amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/276349411267837954">Rene Ritchie&amp;lt;/a>: "Twitter doesn&amp;#185;t want eyeballs on third-party clients.

They told me it was great. They got lots of other people to say they were impressed. And that was the end of the pitch. 	Everyone on the net is busy. All the time. I was riding the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.mta.info/lirr/">LIRR&amp;lt;/a> the other day from Queens to Manhattan, and everyone around me was staring into the screen of their smartphone, tapping, typing, clicking. I watched the faces. They looked like the people sitting around  in the system lab at the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/">UW&amp;lt;/a> Comp Sci Dept in 1978. Same damn thing. Except now instead of a handful of misunderstood geeks, now it's &amp;lt;i>everyone. &amp;lt;/i>	BTW, they didn't look "engaged" or entertained, or even aware of what they're doing. Most of the time we spend pecking and nibbling at stuff on the net we sort of wish there was something more interesting to do. But there isn't, so we keep nibbling and pecking.	And if you're the rare contributor on the net, you might tweet something once in a while. I would call that grunting and snorting.	That's why I like to write blog posts, btw -- it keeps my writing muscles working, for the day when they might be needed again, which I hope I live to see. It would be justice though if it didn't happen. After spending a life selling this idea that people should live on the Internet, to find out that the life wasn't worth living! :-)	Anyway, back to The Daily and why it failed. You might as well ask why the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bobcats">Charlotte Bobcats&amp;lt;/a> failed. Because they can't dribble, pass, shoot, block shots, get rebounds or avoid fouls. As in Charolotte, they didn't even field a team over there in MurdochLand. 	Anyway this is the topic du jour. I'll write the same piece again and again, as I have been for decades, in different contexts. We have the power to do much better, but it's not a &amp;lt;i>requirement. &amp;lt;/i>What's like RSS?	&amp;lt;a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/03/loveRSS.gif" width="65" height="59" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named loveRSS.gif">&amp;lt;/a>To be like RSS, it would have to be some open tech that is free to be used by anyone without royalty, with no individual, corporation or standards body  that can make your development work obsolete. To me, as a developer, that's what open means.	If Apple can deprecate and then remove an API, or not approve an app because it doesn't conform to a rule that didn't even exist when I wrote it -- that's very far from the ideal.	Lots of APIs these days are like that. And since they have corporate sponsors, they're the ones they talk about at tech conferences. Because they can pay for sponsorships. That's how the conference promoters get paid.	I have a reason for asking this question -- I'm wondering if there's enough open technology out there that's not corporate-owned that we could have an interesting meetup among interested parties and get some good cross-pollinating done.	I think this is the core of what Stallman's free software idea is about. I really don't care that much about software, though I respect that he does. What matters to me is that I can ship something and have it keep working indefinitely, without worrying about someone outlawing my work. That kind of power always gets abused (I wonder why anyone would think it wouldn't).	Anyway here's a list of some ideas, but please post comments or send me mail of any formats or protocols that you think should be on this list.		JSON		Markdown		RSS (of course)		OPML		PNGShould feeds require HTTPS?	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/03/accordionGuy.gif" width="135" height="203" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named accordionGuy.gif">I said no, feeds should not require using HTTPS, and got an email from a developer friend asking me to explain, which I am happy to do. 	If you think everyone who wants to read your feeds uses an aggregator that's being regularly updated then you won't lose any readers. But maybe you'll miss the one person who could help everyone understand your product.	Engineers tend to think users are fungible. One user is as good as every other user. So if you lose 1 percent or 5 percent, no big deal. But it might be a big deal. And it might be more than 5 percent. 	However if your users are creating great stuff that a lot of people want to read, then it might not matter, because eventually everyone will get to read your feeds, no matter what they're using. Over time, all aggregators will support HTTPS if enough developers of feeds require it. 	If it should turn out that way, it'll be a pain in the butt to get my aggregator working with HTTPS, but if you make it compelling enough I'll do it. And I'll be pissed because it's time I'd rather spend doing something creative. Not make-work, because I can't see for the life of me why you need to push RSS over a secure connection. :-)Cloud Atlas mini-review	The critics didn't like &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Atlas_(film)">Cloud Atlas&amp;lt;/a>, so I almost didn't see it. That would have been a mistake, because I &amp;lt;i>loved&amp;lt;/i> the movie. Much more than some other movies that got universally good reviews -- Lincoln, Flight and Argo, all of which I thought were yawners.	I loved the way they wove all the stories together, and how they all reached the same places at the same time. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/12/03/cloudAtlas.gif" width="115" height="170" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named cloudAtlas.gif">Most important, it's very much a continuation of The Matrix series. Hugo Weaving even plays the Agent Smith role in a couple of the segments. And like Argo, it mixes slapstick comedy with heavy action, but unlike Argo, they make it work. 		I think the nurse in one of the segments was played by Weaving in drag?			Update: Yes indeed!	I like movies that make simple political points, and I like the message of The Matrix, and I like that they picked it up in Cloud Atlas. 		The simple message -- non-conformist -- be original, don't be a clone! 	Some of the reviewers said the story was confusing, but I wasn't even slightly confused. And I liked that it's also a love story, like The Matrix, but it's sweeter and grabs you at a more emotional level. Not to take anything away from The Matrix which is one of my all-time favorites.	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.nakedjen.com/nakedjen/2012/12/all-the-mystery-all-the-beauty-in-the-world-new-york-city-makes-my-own-heart-do-a-little-dance-it-ma.html">NakedJen&amp;lt;/a> arrives tomorrow for our annual film festival, and I'm going to recommend that she see Cloud Atlas after we see the three Matrix movies. And if you've seen and loved The Matrix, I highly recommend seeing Cloud Atlas. Unfortunately it's probably too late to see it in theaters around the country. It's still playing in NYC on 42nd St and in Kew Gardens. 	Moral of the story -- if critics universally pan a movie that don't mean they're right! :-)Sidewalker map app	Here's an idea for a map-based app.	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/02/beetlejuice.gif" width="150" height="178" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named beetlejuice.gif">The other day I was walking down &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Columbus+Avenue,+New+York,+NY&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=42.746632,-75.770041&amp;sspn=7.502352,9.602051&amp;oq=Columbus+&amp;hnear=Columbus+Ave,+New+York&amp;t=m&amp;z=14">Columbus Ave&amp;lt;/a>, on the west side of the street, and passed an Italian restaurant that looked like a place I'd like. Just a neighborhood restaurant with waiter service, but nothing fancy. They have a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/marios-italian-restaurant-lexington">place&amp;lt;/a> like this in Lexington, Mass that I like to eat at. And &amp;lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/frankie-johnnie-and-luigi-too-mountain-view">one&amp;lt;/a> in Mountain View, Calif. There used to be one of these in every neighborhood in NYC, but nowadays mostly they have are upscale places, which are nice, when you feel upscale. But sometimes you just want a plate of spaghetti with a couple of meatballs and a nice mixed salad with Italian dressing, a big glass of ice tea, for about $10  to $12 plus tip. 	And there it was!	I looked back and made a mental image of the place. I didn't write down the name or address. Now I want to find it. What I'll do is slog through Google Maps street view of the neighborhood. But it would be nice to be able to take a virtual walk down the street, a little faster than I walk IRL. 	Obviously this would have other applications. You get to play virtual tourist. Or do window shopping. Look for a nice nieghborhood to live in a town that's far away. Etc.	Update: The &amp;lt;a href="http://francescospizzanyc.com/">solution&amp;lt;/a> to the puzzle is &amp;lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/francesco-new-york">Francesco's Pizzeria&amp;lt;/a>. Didn't find it via Google Maps. Instead I went by foot to the location and scoped it out. Even took a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8238392999/in/photostream/">picture&amp;lt;/a> this time. :-)		&amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8238392999/in/photostream/lightbox/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/02/francesco.jpg" width="400" height="299" border="0" alt="A picture named francesco.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>	Update: Had a nice plate of &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8253374874/in/photostream">spaghetti and meatballs&amp;lt;/a> on the 7th with Ryan Tate, at Francesco's. Hit the spot perfectly.Just found Talkatone	30 minutes ago I found &amp;lt;a href="http://www.talkatone.com/gettingstarted.html#0">Talkatone&amp;lt;/a>. I came across it because I'm wanting to make phone calls from my LTE-equipped iPad 3. Honestly, I thought when I got around to this, I'd just use the Google Voice app the same way I make calls from my GMail account on my desktop. Apparently it's much more complicated. On my Android phone it was just a matter of asking an automatic dialog that asked if I wanted to use Google Voice instead of T-Mobile for my calls. Of course being a totall Google Voice fan I said yes. Is this because Apple doesn't want GV to work on the iPad? Hmm.	Anyway, Talkatone seems horribly complicated. But I'm sure it's the kind of thing where it makes more sense the second and third times you read the docs. 	PS: And then I came across &amp;lt;a href="http://occupyyourbrain.tumblr.com/post/36966852689/once-again-a-plea-for-mercy">this&amp;lt;/a>. :-)iTunes is an outliner	Doc Searls &amp;lt;a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2012/11/30/journals-are-outlines-journalism-is-outlining/">posted an item&amp;lt;/a> yesterday explaining how journalism is an outline. 	Then also yesterday iTunes 11 came out, and it's the topic du jour. &amp;lt;a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/apple-rolls-out-a-cleaner-itunes/">Pogue says&amp;lt;/a> it's great, overlooking the &amp;lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57556548-37/7-features-apple-killed-off-in-itunes-11/">features&amp;lt;/a> they took out. He says if you complain about iTunes you're a bad person. This, in the Paper of Record. I'll remember that next time they pan a movie I like. (Seriously the Times tech reviews are pretty awful. They used to be great when Sandberg-Diment was doing them.)		His actual words: "iTunes 11 is, on the whole, better than what came before it -- if only because it's faster, far less cluttered and laid out more sensibly. Yes, change always ruffles people's feathers -- you could argue that Apple's specialty is feather-ruffling -- but this time, at least, the overall direction is up."		Bleh. This is typical Pogue. Nasty shit they should edit out, on the chance that their reviewer got it wrong.	Anyway, luckily if you know what pref to turn on, you can get iTunes working again. The way it ships you can't use it to move content onto an iPad or iPod. Not exactly a minor function of iTunes. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/11/itunes_11_it_s_time_for_apple_s_horrible_bloated_program_to_die.html">Farhad Manjoo says&amp;lt;/a> it's time to take iTunes out back and shoot it. It's bad software he says. I'd like to offer the perspective of someone who has made his share of bad software. Go watch the great documentary, &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fog_of_War">The Fog of War&amp;lt;/a>. Most software is like that. A big Ouija board. In one rev you try to solve a problem, but in doing so, you lose the solution to the problem three versions back. So you fix that, and undo something else.	It's like renting office space for a growing company. In the first office you were on the ground floor but had windows that didn't open, so the office was stifling in the summer. So the next office has windows that open. But you forgot how nice it was to be on the ground floor.	The only way software really flows is if you focus relentlessly on a very small set of features, and write down what the rules are, and never break them, and take lots and lots of time to Get It Right.	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/01/iTunesIsAnOutliner.gif">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/01/iTunesIsAnOutlinerSmall.gif" width="400" height="266" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 0; padding-top: 0; padding-right: 0;" alt="A picture named iTunesIsAnOutlinerSmall.gif">&amp;lt;/a>That's why it's important to study something like iTunes to figure out what it really is, and don't just tack on annexes and add-ons to suit the needs of the next "Stevenote" demo. When you step back and look, and think and think some more, you'll see that it's an outliner. You have devices to hook in, and apps on those devices, and songs and playlists. Every one of which is a hierarchy. And you're moving and copying things from one hierarchy to another. When I realized that &amp;lt;i>everything&amp;lt;/i> in computers was like this, I decided to make a tool that was really excellent at editable hierarchies, so I wouldn't have to keep making shitty little outliners for every one-off problem. Because managing iPods is a lot like managing documents on a hard drive or ideas that make up a presentation or a business plan or a set of software reviews. Why have five miserable iTunes-like tools when one really great one will do? That way you keep the fog down to a minimum. (Remember to go see the movie if you haven't already.)	I thought Apple would copy us and put an outliner in the Mac Toolbox. Should have happened in the late 80s. But for whatever reason they didn't do it. So they're still stuck in the fog of outliners shuffling stuff from one rev to the next. Until that major reconceive happens, it won't do any good to start over.Don't blame the Repubs	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/12/01/chockFullONuts.gif" width="145" height="145" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named chockFullONuts.gif">Who can blame the Republicans for their lies if the press is willing to carry them, verbatim, as if there were some truth to what they're saying?	It's like the &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+sul">SUL fiasco&amp;lt;/a> in the Twitter world a couple of years ago. 	Who can blame Twitter if pubs like TechCrunch, Mashable, GigaOm, ReadWriteWeb were willing to take bribes in the form of millions of followers, openly. If I were running Twitter and could get away with that, I'd seriously consider doing the same. 	Business people have an obligation to follow the law, as do Congress people. But their first obligations are to their shareholders and to get re-elected. If the press is willing to sacrifice its integrity and it helps your cause -- you might want to go for it. Twitter did, and the Repubs do. 	None of this will change until we change the way journalism works.&lt;/pre>February 2013 = &lt;pre>Don't slog away at the end of the day	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/28/mrNatural.gif" width="150" height="149" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named mrNatural.gif">Here's one of the fundamental rules of programming.	You're at the end of your day, you've gotten a lot of stuff done, and you have one more thing to get right before the feature is complete, and you're searching for the answer, trying all kinds of ideas, thoroughly confused, not wanting to get up until it's done, just slogging away and not getting it. Finally, you give up after a couple of hours of spinning your wheels, eat some dinner, watch a little basketball, have a glass of wine, read a little and crash for the night. 	Get up the next morning, make some coffee, read the news, roll up your sleeves and start over with the problem.	Five minutes later it's done. 	Happens every damned time. 	The problem isn't intractable. It's just as difficult as all the other problems you solved the previous day. It just came after your mind  shut down. So you might as well quit work a couple of hours earlier.	Programming isn't like digging trenches. The amount of work you get done is not directly proportional to the amount of time you work. Also believe it or not your mind is solving problems while you sleep. That's why the answer is apparent first thing in the morning. Even after 30 years of programming, I'm still learning this lesson. Why you should learn to code	I actually &amp;lt;i>do&amp;lt;/i> think people should learn to code, at least a little -- just as you learn a little chemistry, biology and math in school. Learning how to program is imho easier than those things, but then I have a natural ability to program, so what do I know. :-)	But I don't like the way people at &amp;lt;a href="http://www.code.org/quotes">code.org&amp;lt;/a> are pitching it. And I don't like &amp;lt;i>who&amp;lt;/i> is doing the pitching, and who isn't. Out of the 83 people they quote, I doubt if many of them have written code recently, and most of them have never done it, and have no idea what they're talking about.	If I were encouraging young people to learn to play basketball, at least I would have had the experience of playing a little myself when I was younger, and having watched a lot of it recently. I'm in awe of basketball players. How fast they charge at the basket with such reckless abandon for their own safety. They fall on hard wood at high speeed. That must hurt! But they get right up and play as if nothing happened. But there are plenty of basketball players to talk about basketball. So why aren't there very many programmers who can talk about coding? If I were a young person looking at this, I'd wonder what was up with that. They're telling me what a wonderful career it is. Where are the people who do it, and what do &amp;lt;i>they&amp;lt;/i> have to say?	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/27/clyde.gif" width="161" height="258" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named clyde.gif">Which brings me to the second problem I have with the way they pitch it.	Suppose I said you should learn to play basketball because you can make a lot of money doing it. I wonder how Chris Bosh would feel about that. Or if I said you should learn to create music for the same reason? I bet will.i.am would have a problem with that. You don't learn an art to make money -- you learn it because it's fun and satisfying. Because it's what you were meant to do. You do it because you like it so much that it's what you want to do every day of your life. Because you want to get really good at it. To perfect your art, and achieve a greater goal. Imagine telling young people they should learn to do something because "To compete in a global market, our students need high quality STEM education including computer science skills such as coding." Okay. I'd run away from that as fast as I can. 		I like what Bill Gates said: "Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains." It's very true, and a good argument for students in all disciplines learning at least a little programming.	These people don't themselves know how to do what they want you to do. So what they say makes no sense. It won't make you rich, but it will make &amp;lt;i>them&amp;lt;/i> rich. And if you do it, they won't listen to you. And even worse, if you do what they want you to do, you'll be tossed out on the street without any way to earn a living when you turn 35 or 40. Even though you're still a perfectly good programmer. 	It's a shitty system, and it needs to be fixed. And we have to get these spokespeople who don't know anytihng about what we do to stop speaking for us. To get out of the way. What we need to do, as programmers, is start helping young people become really good at what we do, so they can do it even if there are a lot of carpetbaggers trying to redefine it. (What's a carpetbagger? You should study a little history too!)	To be clear, you should learn to code if:	1. You love writing and debugging and refining and documenting and supporting code. 	2. You love to see the working result of your labors. 	3. It excites you to empower other people (your users and other developers).	4. You have modest financial needs.	5. Don't mind spending a lot of time working by yourself.	6. Don't mind being misunderstood.	Primarily you should do it because you love it, because it's fun -- because it's wonderful to create machines with your mind. Hugely empowering. Emotionally gratifying. Software is math-in-motion. It's a miracle of the mind. And if you can do it, really well, there's absolutely nothing like it. 	I wrote a piece about &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html#5">programmers&amp;lt;/a> in 1997. "Successful programmers know how to ask questions, and they know how to ask the &amp;lt;i>right&amp;lt;/i> question. You can't go forward until that happens. A programmer is a rigorous scientist determined to coax the truth out of the ones and zeros. There's the beauty." 	BTW, I also think every student should learn to be a journalist and a lawyer and an accountant too. That way you'll be able to blog with authority. And will know when you're getting screwed. And keep your taxes down like rich people do. :-)Good software design is ageless	&amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/doYouUseYourOwnProduct#comment-806241319">A comment&amp;lt;/a> from Michael Markman: &amp;lt;i>"I'm an older dog than Dave Winer -- by about a decade. And I've managed to learn this new trick: move one finger, the pointer moves. Use two fingers and the window scrolls."&amp;lt;/i>	Necessary recital: I'm 57 and have been developing software since I was 18. 	He's wrong. I would have been just as upset about the feature-removal at 25 as I am today. It has nothing to do with age. And as a software designer, something that I've been doing for a long time and know quite well, I can tell you why it's bad to remove features. I learned it the hard way, by doing it. 	I once shipped a product for the Apple II and IBM PC. When we made the Mac version we started a new codebase, largely because of the new way of doing UI. We wanted to ship before we had all the features ported and debugged, so we did. The users saw this as &amp;lt;i>taking features out of the product,&amp;lt;/i> even though technically that isn't what we did. They were angry about the removal. I bet a lot of them were my age at the time (28), that is, younger than Michael and myself. And they were right to be upset. We called both products ThinkTank. They expected when they opened the box (software shipped in boxes back then) they would get the same thing, but translated to the Macintosh. They didn't. So they concluded that we had removed features. 	Key lesson: Users don't see things from the same perspective as we do. 	And users build up processes that designers know nothing about. They work around the limits of our software by using other features to emulate the ones they wish were there. When we play with the mix of features, we break them. Why would you want to do that to someone who was smart enough to buy your product, and might buy an upgrade someday. Don't you want your users to be successful? Isn't that why you're making software. All these are reasons why anyone, not just Apple, should strive for continutity for users. I suppose there are times when you &amp;lt;i>have&amp;lt;/i> to break users. But to break them for aesthetic reasons, when it's totally optional, that's a sign of bad things to come. A company that has decided willfully not to value their users. 	I'm reminded of this many times every day, as I work around the missing scroll-arrows feature. I remember it used to be there. A sin that's hard to forgive. And it's an important one to observe, because more and more the designers at big tech companies are, for some reason impossible for me to understand, sabotaging their own products by removing features that users depend on. It's becoming more commonplace. And it's a trend that will make users seek out stability as a desired feature.	People do switch for stability, btw. I switched from Windows to Mac, at considerable expense, because at the time Windows was  infected with malware and the platform vendor wasn't fixing the product. I could switch again, if the Mac becomes too unstable and another platform appears to be rocking less. The Sequester	We're in constant Congress-induced crisis mode in the US. 	It's gotten so routine, I don't even pay attention anymore. I suspect a lot of other people do the same.	I kind of hope the Republicans don't back down, and let the sequester happen, and then the voters may finally see the connection between what they do and what the Congress does. I think our Red State fellow citizens have been using their vote for entertainment purposes. To watch the assholes they elect stick it to the rich and sophisticated "elites" in the big east coast and west coast states. But when the cuts hit their communities just as hard as they hit ours, they may think again. I hope they do. 	We need to run this country a little more like a business. We have to think these things through. We want Medicare and Social Security, and we don't mind paying for them, but somehow we want them cut at the same time? Hello. That's no way to run an economy.	Whatever. I'm beginning to think maybe the cynics are right and this is all just sleight-of-hand, to keep us distracted while the real action is somewhere else. Yeah, that's probably it. Watching Marco's Magazine	I've been watching Marco Arment's publishing venture, called The Magazine, with interest and a little puzzlement. It looks like a high wall around writing, the kind of wall that was natural before publishing got cheap, first with laser printing and page layout software, then with the web and blogging. 	When I started blogging, with &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">DaveNet&amp;lt;/a>, in 1994 -- people in the tech industry who read it thought for sure it was just a demo, and eventually I would charge a fee. Something like the $495 per year that &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson">Esther Dyson&amp;lt;/a> and &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Alsop_II">Stewart Alsop&amp;lt;/a> charged for their tech industry newsletters. I told everyone that I would never do that, but they still seemed to believe I would eventually charge. 	But I didn't and I never would for this simple reason. I was having so much influence with the free and openly published email/web essays that it made no sense to limit the flow. I also never thought of my writing as my bread and butter, so in fairness, I could afford to give it away because it was a &amp;lt;i>by-product&amp;lt;/i> of my real work, not the work itself, which was writing software. 	So maybe I wasn't so smart, just had my center in a different place. Whatever, I was sure I wouldn't charge, and in the 19 years since, I never have.	Now Marco has &amp;lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/02/24/the-magazine-sharing">changed&amp;lt;/a> his policy, and the articles appear on the web in addition to being in his iOS-based magazine app. It's a complex scheme that allows readers to point to articles to share them on the web. But you can only read one article for free per month. I don't see why this is a major difference from having an absolute and impenetrable paywall. One time, when I click on a link, I get to read the article. Every other time, I'll get an ad to buy a subscription, I guess. As a &amp;lt;a href="http://links.scripting.com/">linker&amp;lt;/a>, I wouldn't like to send my readers to ads for a publication. I might read an article and think it essential for everyone to read, but wouldn't share it.	I am the kind of person who, when I read an article, if I make it all the way to the end, I'm pretty likely to forward it to all my followers. I have this systematized, with &amp;lt;a href="http://docs.reallysimple.org/">software&amp;lt;/a> that makes it super-easy. I also will forward a link to articles that I want to remember to read. I figure if it's important enough for me to want to read later, then it's important enough for the people who follow me to get that link so they can read it too. My linkflow is a sort of memory system. I use it the way some people use Marco's Instapaper, or Readability, or the way they used to use del.icio.us, or any of a dozen other tools that remember links to look at later. 	But because sharing links is such a central part of my reading process, I almost never read articles that can't be shared. It means I've never read an article that's published in Marco's Magazine. It's not out of principle. Maybe he's right. If so, eventually I may have to give in. I don't subscribe to the WSJ or the NYT either, although I have at times been tempted to go for the NYT plan. If it were simpler and if I believed I could easily unsub I probably would.	Anyway, I'm still watching. I suspect he will find equilibrium with full sharing on the web. The pull is just too great. I bet that most good writers want to influence with their writing more than they want to be paid for it. Everyone likes a small paycheck, but if it interferes with the purpose of writing, that creates a conundrum. I think that long-term the desire to influence will win-out.Young folk and greatness	I was once a very young man with some talent, and luck and perhaps intuition that led me to a place where, at 25, I had arrived somewhere that few people did. Everywhere I went people reminded me what a miracle I was. But there were other people my own age who were even more miraculous, richer and more accomplished. This brewed a soup of emotions that were pretty intense -- pride, arrogance mixed with jealousy and anger. 	We were all difficult to be around, maybe I was more difficult than most. But because I could make "magic" happen with the computer, this was somewhat tolerated. It wasn't until I was in my mid-40s that things began to settle down. I realized that while my life might have been different from most people, more elevated in some ways -- I was actually a pretty ordinary person. I learned that the more I could make my actual life normal, the closer to happy I would become. 	I'm still able to work the stuff that people who don't know call magic, but I realize now as I did then, that it isn't magic at all. There's a &amp;lt;i>process&amp;lt;/i> to creativity. All you have to go by when you're younger is intuition, and the feedback of others who say your talent is without precedent, unless you have coaches who help give you a sense of perspective, who give you a safe harbor to create within, and while giving you positive feedback when your work is excellent, keep reminding you to seek balance. Enjoy your youth, in a physical way. Enjoy the simple everyday pleasures of living. Do not believe the accolades. Strive to do better, and keep your eye on the long arc of life, not just the here-and-now. 	We, as a society, make a big mistake when we pump the egos of our young talented people. Love everyone, not just the rich. Don't believe that people are prodigies, they aren't. When people create something you like, tell them! But don't think they're gods. Era of the big man is over	This is a basketball story, but not really.	There was a time when bigger was better. If you worked at the biggest company you were smarter, more powerful, better looking, knew what was happening. 	You could see over our heads. 	But that was then. Now it's about being fast of feet and mind. Thinking not just where the puck is going but how to replace the puck with something better. 	That's why the Lakers are the past and the Rockets are the future.	Think small picture, not big.Apple arguing with iTself on my iMac	I just plugged my iPad into my iMac and launched iTunes.	A dialog appeared saying there's a new version of iOS for the iPad. Would I like to download and iNstall it. Yes.	A few seconds later a dialog appears saying there's a new version of iTunes. Same question. Yes. 	I think you can see where this is headed. :-)	Some piece of software says that I can't install a new version of iTunes unless I quit iTunes. So I try to quit. Then I get a dialog wanting to confirm that I want to quit iTunes while my iPad is being updated with the new version of iOS. Either way, no or yes, gets me more dialogs. I can't get out of this loop any way other than to force quit all the software that's running that's orchestrating this Kafkaesque madness. 	Somewhere Steve Jobs is rolling over in his grave. (Or at least rolling his eyes.)Vanity Fair led me back to Pulp Fiction and to a great blog	Warning: Spoilers ahead! :-)	I spent the day in Cambridge yesterday. One of my stops was the Shorenstein Center, where I was interviewed as part of a project to understand the transition of journalism to the Internet. At one point I was asked who were some of my favorite bloggers. I said I don't like that kind of question, because I think it misses the point of blogging. I gave an example.	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/21/juliaWolfBig.jpg">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/21/julia.jpg" width="105" height="155" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named julia.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>1. On Tuesday I read an &amp;lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/03/making-of-pulp-fiction-oral-history">article&amp;lt;/a> in Vanity Fair about the making of Pulp Fiction.	2. That caused me to watch the movie again. I hadn't seen it in a long time. I wasn't sure if I had even seen it more than once. 	3. Great movie. 	4. Near the end of the movie there's a scene with Wolf, Vincent and Jules at the junkyard. Wolf is going to breakfast with a delicious young babe who owns the junkyard where they had disposed of a car that was used in a crime. I wondered who the babe was. 	5. When the credits rolled I noted her name. Googled her. Found she has a &amp;lt;a href="http://juliasweeney.blogspot.com/">blog.&amp;lt;/a>	6. Spent the next hour reading it. She's a great writer. It's 20 years later. She's done a lot of living. And blogged about a lot of it. She reads books and watches movies and keeps a log of them. 	That story illustrates perfectly for me why blogs are so valuable. It's not that any single person has a blog, or is famous for it. It's that blogging is available to anyone who wants to blog. Not everyone does. But with &amp;lt;a href="http://juliasweeney.blogspot.com/">Julia Sweeney&amp;lt;/a> I hit blogging paydirt. An attractive person who turns out to have something to say. Nice. 	PS: &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/21/kathyGriffin.jpg">Kathy Griffin&amp;lt;/a> was in PF too.Do you use your own product?	&amp;lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/36518280/misc/imac.gif" width="125" height="200" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named imac.gif">The "Lion" version of the Macintosh operating system removed what was, to me, a very important feature -- the arrows at either end of scrollbars. I found this out when I bought a new laptop, which I'm using now to write this piece, and discovered the omission. I wrote a blog post about it at the time, and was told by Mac advocates not to worry that I would discover better ways to do the same thing. That didn't happen, but since I don't use the laptop that often, I muddled along without the arrows.	Then, late last year, I updated my Mac desktop to the latest model. It has a nicer screen, is a little slimmer, has a faster CPU, faster disk, etc. This time I couldn't side-step the missing scroll arrows. And since this is my main work machine, muddling along meant less productivity. More lost trains-of-thought as I have to locate the scroll thumb and delicately move it up or down small amounts to get the text to scroll by two or three lines. The scroll arrows are always in the same place, and you click once to move by one line. No care required. 	Finally, last week, I decided it was time to actually find the "better way" the people spoke of earlier. Only to discover it didn't exist. After hearing from lots of users in the comments, the best approach people have come up with is to use the arrow keys on the keyboard. But that's no answer. If I have to lift my hand of the mouse, find the keyboard, and find the arrow keys (does it even have arrow keys, I never use them). 	All this makes me wonder if the people at Apple actually use Macs, and if they do, do they hate themselves? Certainly someone there must have depended on the arrows as a way of fine-tuning the vertical position of text on the screen? As I do.	So a few times every day I lose my train of thought because I use a new Mac instead of an old one. I can't figure out for the life of me why they would take features out of their products. I would say it might be to get us to leave their platform and use Windows, but they're playing even worse tricks on their users. Dinner in Cambridge on Wednesday?	I'll be in Cambridge, MA on Wednesday, staying overnight and am free for dinner, so let's have a meetup!	I posted an &amp;lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/berkman-thursday/message/2844">item&amp;lt;/a> on the Berkman-Thursday list (awkward because this is a Wednesday night event, but it's the people that matter, imho, not the day). 	Some possible items for discussion.	Hey what do you guys think of Jeremy Lin? I love that he came from Harvard.	I've been programming in JavaScript in the browser for the last few months. Would be happy to share observations.	I'm coming to meet with some folks at Shorenstein and at MIT, and am working on a super-secret project which I might leak about if properly incentivized.	Hey I don't want to make a big deal of this, but I remember fondly the discussions we used to have way-back-when in the Old Country with the Sad Beatles and all that.		&amp;lt;a href="http://crimson1.scripting.com/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/18/sadBeatles.jpg" width="84" height="101" border="0" alt="A picture named sadBeatles.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>	I hear they tore down our building. How can something like that happen.	One more thing. I heard that Bombay Club is &amp;lt;a href="http://www.readability.com/articles/yb2hnh5q">closed&amp;lt;/a>. That, and climate change, is enough to cause one to lose hope, I think. But the Red Sox have won the championship, so that's something. I can't imagine what their fans will do now without the curse to lament. 	Anyway, if there's enough interest we'll pick a restaurant, and post the details here before Wednesday night.Dear NYC Journo Brain Trust	&amp;lt;i>I sent this email to some friends yesterday and realized it should probably be a blog post.&amp;lt;/i>	This idea came in a roundabout way...	1. Google Reader has been sputtering lately.	2. Causing some users to be nervous.	3. They reach out to developers they know who care, including me. Asking if I can offer any help.	4. The only help I can offer is my mind. My programming resources are going elsewhere, and this is not the kind of job a person or a small team can approach. Because while news looks easy and simple, there are millions of feeds, and all must be read every so often or else the system doesn't work. It means you need fairly real capital to make this happen.	5. Either Google is or isn't going to continue to subsidize the news reading activity. Either way it's not good to be so dependent on them.	6. So I approach some famous tech companies, get a hearing, and am told there might be money available for this, but no interest in doing it as a service. Makes sense. I don't want to do it either.	7. It is suggested that perhaps a university or library might want to do this. To which I say -- not likely, for many reasons.	8. Then, after sleeping on it -- I have one of those AHA moments. 	9. Why isn't this something a news org jumps on. It's their business. And for crying out loud -- do it with a revenue model. No paywall. Just charge the users for the service. Make this a market. Let's start building in a non-fragile way. 	I don't know what to do with this other than give the idea to people who might have some influence at the news orgs. Forward it where ever you like.Posterous archive received	I was able to download my Posterous archive. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/dave/daveWinerPosterousArchive.zip">http://static.scripting.com/dave/daveWinerPosterousArchive.zip&amp;lt;/a>	I'm busy with other projects, but wanted to be sure I could find this if I find time to move it to another location.	I took a brief look inside, and it looks fine. The posts are stored as RSS 2.0 items. Shouldn't be hard for any experienced blogging software developer to work with this.Tesla v NY Times	A fascinating conflict is brewing between Elon Musk the founder of Tesla Motors and John Broder, a reporter for the NY Times who reviewed the Tesla Model S. 	Margaret Sullivan, the NY Times public editor has a good &amp;lt;a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/conflicting-assertions-over-an-electric-car-test-drive/">summary&amp;lt;/a> of the dispute, so far. 	Some obvious observations.	1. The whole thing is good for Tesla. I hadn't seen the original review, but after seeing Musk's initial review-of-the-review, I became interested. Someday I might buy a Tesla as a result of the increased interest. It'll take a number of events like this to get me to buy, but a car is a big purchase, so it seems it should take a lot of work to close the deal. 	2. Before this, the most memorable thing I had heard about the Tesla was from Evan Williams who said it was the iPhone of cars. That made sense to me, and Williams saying it made a difference. I believe he understands what makes an iPhone nice. And cars are not designed like iPhones, but it might be nice if they were. :-)	3. Had it been any publication other than the Times, they wouldn't have had Margaret Sullivan to rep the news side of it. This is possibly a big deal. I have been impressed with Ms Sullvivan's work so far, after being very irritated by her predecessors. They didn't seem to rep the public. Mostly they explained why the Times insiders were right all along and the public was wrong. 	4. Even though I'm a fan, I think public editors should be from the public, not journalism. And a publication of the stature of the Times should have many of them. The rule is they could put something on the Times website, adjacent to the articles they're commenting on, and they could say whatever they need to say to create balance. They wouldn't have indefinite terms, and it would be possible to fire them, but only if they breached ethical standards themselves. 		Some stories need lots of public editors, and maybe the public editors should be given anonymity. An example is the run-up to the war in Iraq when all the publications carried the same wrong story. Another, more recent example is the telling of the life story of Aaron Swartz. I knew Aaron, and I read many of the stories, shaking my head at the awful reporting. You can forgive Aaron's friends for distorting the truth, perhaps -- they were grieving. But what were the reporters' excuses? If they were emotionally tied to the story they should have been excused. The purpose of a news publication is to tell the truth, especially if it's unpopular. The Times  has a public editor because it wasn't living up to this ideal, and they knew it, and presumably wanted to do something to fix it. But it's too big a job for just one person. 	5. All pubs should have someone like Ms Sullivan. Over the years, I've had a number of disputes that cut to the integrity of reporters at major publications, like the one Mr Musk has with the Times. None of them have had public editors, and none of them ever resolved the issue one way or the other. One even threatened to sue me for libel if I didn't stop saying they were doing something wrong (a British publication). Imagine if a software company threatened every user who reported a bug. I told them to go ahead. At least it would have raised the issue in a way they would have had to respond to.	6. Just like all software has bugs, all publications have breaches of integrity. The question isn't whether or not you have them, you do. The question is what you do when someone raises an issue.	7. I've long felt that each blogger who values his or her reputiation should have a panel of "rabbis" who will respond to public integrity challenges. If my rabbis say I have to address a certain issue, then I will. If they say it's not an issue, I can go about my business without responding. This would do a lot to increase confidence, and also protect us from troll-like accusations. I think it's possible the same system could work for publications too. Sort of a shared public editor function, for organizations that don't have the resources to hire one of their own.	8. It's possible that Musk is a troll. It's also possible that Broder made it up. I don't expect Sullivan to say either of these things unless it's so obvious as to be indisputable. And it won't be. She will tell us what both sides say and will look at the data herself. She'll look at what others say, and will suggest that while Musk has a fine product he has probably engaged in a little self-promotion here. And that the Times can and should have some new policy for testing cars. We will get a decent list of sources to examine ourselves, and we will, as always, make up our own minds. Mac scrollbar woes	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/15/magicMouse.gif" width="125" height="70" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named magicMouse.gif">It's been a few months since I got my new iMac and with it was forced to switch to Mountain Lion. I've more or less made my peace with everything except this -- the arrows on the scroll bars are gone. This means what was once an automatic operation that required almost no thought now requires me to swtich gears, locate the thumb and move it different amounts depending on how long the document is. When I first observed this, people said not to worry -- you'll get used to the new way of doing things. But the New Way so far has not revealed itself. So please, do tell, what's the recommended &amp;lt;i>fast&amp;lt;/i> way to get the current window to scroll just a little in one direction or another, using the mouse?

I used to live on Sharon Park, so I'd drive by the gas station pretty much every day. I was also a smoker then, Marlboro Lights, at least two packs a day, sometimes more. I had a thing where I'd never buy a carton, figuring that kept me conscious of how much I was smoking. It didn't really work. The gas station that sold the cigarettes was only a few blocks away. A two-minute drive, at most. "Two packs of Marlboro Lights, please" that was something I said at least once a day. Sometimes more than once. 		&amp;lt;iframe width="650" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=sand+hill+road+and+sharon+park+drive&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Sand+Hill+Rd+%26+Sharon+Park+Dr,+Menlo+Park,+San+Mateo,+California+94025&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;source=embed&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=37.424159,-122.195918&amp;amp;panoid=a-1RhIX067urQjyNC1t_sw&amp;amp;cbp=11,201.36,,0,-2.08&amp;amp;ll=37.39621,-122.19595&amp;amp;spn=0.027275,0.05579&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;output=svembed">&amp;lt;/iframe>&amp;lt;br />&amp;lt;small>&amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=sand+hill+road+and+sharon+park+drive&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Sand+Hill+Rd+%26+Sharon+Park+Dr,+Menlo+Park,+San+Mateo,+California+94025&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;source=embed&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=37.424159,-122.195918&amp;amp;panoid=a-1RhIX067urQjyNC1t_sw&amp;amp;cbp=11,201.36,,0,-2.08&amp;amp;ll=37.39621,-122.19595&amp;amp;spn=0.027275,0.05579&amp;amp;z=14" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">View Larger Map&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;/small>	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/07/nemo.gif" width="145" height="110" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named nemo.gif">One day I went into the gas station to buy some smokes, and the guy behind the counter couldn't seem to find them or hear me, or whatever. I must have said three different times "Two packs of Marlboro Lights, please." He was sweating. Really confused. At first I took it as a sign of disrespect, anger rose, but I tried to hide it. After what seemed an eternity of not getting what I wanted, something clicked for me. "This guy is having a hard time." That's very different from "He's giving &amp;lt;i>me&amp;lt;/i> a hard time." I realized he wasn't my problem, and I wasn't his. He had problems, but they had nothing to do with me. So I stopped, took a big breath, smiled, and waited. He brought me what I asked for, I gave him the money. I smiled and said "Have a great day."	He smiled back and said he was sorry. I said no worries man. (Or something like that.) I smiled again and turned to leave.	I always think of that day when I get into a tight spot with someone, a friend sometimes, a person in a store or on the subway, in an airport. This is a person who is trying to do his or her best, given the circumstances, and for whatever reason, having nothing to do with me, is having trouble. I'm going to try to make it easier for them. 	The point of this story is -- nothing. I just thought it was time to write it. :-)	Have a great day! Thanks to Jeff Atwood	I tried to fit this into a tweet and I came close but couldn't quite squeeze it in.	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/06/discourseStaff.gif" width="145" height="103" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 30px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named discourseStaff.gif">I was glad to see &amp;lt;a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse&amp;lt;/a>, released today. It's open source discussion software. &amp;lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/02/civilized-discourse-construction-kit.html">Jeff Atwood&amp;lt;/a>, the developer, is one of the best programmers around, and he really knows discussion software. Too often people stop moving the ball forward when they achieve success. I don't know why. Do great directors hang it up after their first hit? Basketball players? Rock stars? Why should creative people in tech be any different.	I think we're about to see a wave of technically excellent software in a lot of different categories. Feels that way to me. More software like Discourse that can be hooked into everything else, and we'll be looking at a lot of new opportunity for everyone.	I think we're on the cusp of some exciting times. 	Thanks Jeff. :-)Kids are scientists	A great &amp;lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/188/kid-logic">episode&amp;lt;/a> of This American Life about children as scientists.	A little girl on her first airplane ride, after takeoff asks an adult when will they get small? She had seen planes take off at the airport, and after they took off they all got small.	Children are scientists. Even things you'd think were obvious, like gravity -- are mysteries to children. But they are born investigors and practitioners of the Scientific Method. That's something we all understand at birth, it seems. 	There's a wonderful story in there about a child discovering Jesus and Martin Luther King.	When I was a kid I used to watch a daily kids show. The kids would have lunch, and before they ate they would say together "God is great, god is good and we thank him for this food." I came from a family where we didn't talk about god, so it was a strange concept. I figured God was one of the people who worked at the TV station and brought the food in. 	I tried to remember when I learned that God wasn't a stagehand, but I couldn't remember that part.	Update: Just remembered another one, also about TV. I didn't get &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh_track">laugh-tracks&amp;lt;/a>. I kind of figured out that there are millions of people watching, and so many are laughing, that a very small portion of the laughs leak back through the TV network and come out on everyone's sets. It never occurred to me that there was either a studio audience laughing or (more likely) a tape that was played when the producers thought there should be laughter. 	I also thought everyone who was on TV immediately became a millionaire. People seemed so excited about being on TV, I figured they must be making a lot of money. :-)House of News	&amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/houseOfCards">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/03/houseOfCards.gif" width="145" height="186" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named houseOfCards.gif">&amp;lt;/a>I just got through watching the series &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/houseOfCards">House of Cards&amp;lt;/a> and believe it or not, it leads me to a set of observations about news, and where it should be now, and the changes called-for are long overdue.	1. I'm a fan of modern TV series, as many people are. I love The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, The Wire, Deadwood, The West Wing, Battlestar Galactica, Breaking Bad, Homeland, Mad Men. There are so many, and they're great. 	2. I love watching them as I would read a book, at my own pace. 	3. This is a theme of modern media. It's why Napster was such a breakthrough. All of a sudden instead of being programmed, I could do the programming myself. Same thing with the travel industry, vacation rentals, retail, love -- everything. By now the pattern should be obvious to everyone. The users do the programming now. It creates new interest in, and demand for, creativity. THe fear of the entertainment industry was a fear of change. There was never a reason to be scared of irrelevance. Creativity is more in demand now that it ever was. 	4. It's as if the Netflix management had a come-to-jesus type off-site and the chairman said to his people -- what do our customers really want and let's see if we can give it to them. The result was House of Cards. Exactly on the terms that the users have been demanding since Napster. Entertain us, but we want to do the programming ourselves. We &amp;lt;i>will&amp;lt;/i> do the programming ourselves, whether you like it or not. It's our time, our lives, our way of appreciating each other. 	5. Did it work? Yes. Was it as great as the others? It showed promise at the beginning of being as epic as The Wire or West Wing, but it trailed off into ridiculousness. That's okay. Homeland did that too. Will I pay for Season 2, if there is one? Yes I will, without a doubt.	6. And get this, I didn't just pay for it, I signed up for $8 a month. I had been a longtime Netflix customer, but late last year, I unsubbed. But they got me back. And the deeper I got into House of Cards, the more they got me back. I'll give them another year, let's see what they come up with.	7. Now what does this have to do with news? 	8. Everything. News needs to do the same recalc. Come-to-jesus and let's figure out what it is that the customers want, exactly, and give it to them, no compromises -- and see what happens. It's what you're doing anyway, as you pretend the pre-Internet news distribution system still exists. 	9. When you do that, you'll see very clearly that what the news industry needs is a cooperative venture that's external to all the news orgs, as Hulu was to the entertainment divisions of the networks, and boot up a new distribution system. Twitter and Facebook have shown you how to do it, although it wasn't necessary to wait this long -- you've now waited long enough. The new system will look like Twitter. You have to be present everywhere your news is in demand. The news industry should have a system tailored to the realities of news, the way Netflix has moved to become the HBO of the Internet age. We need news like that too.	10. News orgs should also bring bloggers in-house, not to write for their pubs, but to co-locate intellectually. I wrote about this in an earlier &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/january/ifTheNytHadCojones">piece&amp;lt;/a>, where I suggested the NYT do this. I did not mean to say that they should publish the bloggers in the paper or on its website. Just house them on premises. I'm thinking about serendipity. Overhearing elevator conversations. Eating lunch in the same cafeteria, waiting in the same line for the coffee cart. Inevitably the two cultures will influence each other and this would be good for both. 	11. Same thing with users and the flow of news. Use the same follower model that Twitter uses. Have USA Today compete with a random group of bloggers located nowhere in particular. We will develop new tools that let people combine news in a multitude of ways. The same way we want to program our entertainment, we must be able to program our news flows. 	12. Twitter is being very cooperative by closing off channels of innovation to developers. You can harness that energy immediately by zigging to their zag. Unlike movies, which are best viewed serially, news allows for much more varied types of flows. Some people believe this can happen to video too, but much more has been possible with news for the last decade. 	This thread will continue.House of Cards	&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(U.S._TV_series)">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/03/houseOfCards.gif" width="145" height="186" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named houseOfCards.gif">&amp;lt;/a>Back in November I &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/whyIQuitNetflix">signed off&amp;lt;/a> Netflix. I wasn't using the service, had probably watched two or three movies in all of 2012, and it bothered me that I was paying $8 a month for something I wasn't using. I put off resigning because I figured it would be a pain. I had to call them to do it, but it wasn't as difficult as it had been years ago to get off AOL or MSN. 	But then I started hearing about &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(U.S._TV_series)">House of Cards&amp;lt;/a>. It was getting a huge rollout. On the web and in podcasts. It's exactly the kind of show I like, political drama, a series, and it all came out at once. I am definitely one of those people who likes to watch shows quickly, in a serial fashion. I watched the first few seasons of The Wire that way, and have worked my way through a bunch of other series since then, watching episodes the way I'd read a novel.	They got me. I turned my Netflix account back on. They didn't toss any of my data. I'm not surprised, but I'm also not necessarily happy about that. I just watched Episode 7. Took a break to watch a &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fincher">David Fincher&amp;lt;/a> movie I hadn't seen in a long time -- &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(1997_film)">The Game&amp;lt;/a>. Loved it even more this time than I did the first time. The story is very moving. If House of Cards is as emotionally grabbing as The Game it will be a huge winner.	One thing that's missing from House of Cards, that you get from other serial dramas like Breaking Bad or Homeland, is the ability to discuss it with people online. It's tough because people are either a few episodes ahead or behind. I don't want spoilers, and I don't want to be a spoiler. We need to invent new communication systems, where only people who have made it through Episode X can discuss with others who have made it exactly that far. 	Update: &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/restructuringNews">Conclusions&amp;lt;/a> after watching all 13 episodes. No spoilers. :-)How am I doing?	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/01/koch.gif" width="250" height="115" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named koch.gif">&amp;lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ed-koch-mayor-symbol-nyc-dies-article-1.1252914">The death&amp;lt;/a> of &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Koch">Mayor Koch&amp;lt;/a> is not a surprise. At 88 he had become frail. Now come the memorials. Let's hope they don't lose their perspective. Ed Koch was no saint. He had a sharp tongue, and over his many years in public life he made many enemies. But he was also much loved in NY. Before Koch, the city was drifting in a post-Robert Moses funk. It was dirty and unsafe and in many ways just didn't work. Koch did much to turn the city around. And he didn't apologize for being a New Yorker. When he asked "How am I doing?" don't think it wasn't with much irony. What could &amp;lt;i>possibly&amp;lt;/i> stop a New Yorker from telling you how you're doing. And it's not usually going to come with a hug or a pat on the back, although Koch was the exception, on the boardwalk in Coney Island or in the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/nyregion/edward-i-koch-ex-mayor-of-new-york-dies.html">subway&amp;lt;/a> under Manhattan, people told him to keep up the good work. We appreciated what he was doing for the city. NY is and was and always will be a tough place, on a personal level. But it's a place of symbols. Koch was us, and the reflection wasn't so bad. We have a sense of humor, a sense of what-the-fuck. Somehow we'll get through this, and a feeling that it can be better if we work together, dammit. Koch embodied that for his generation.&lt;/pre>January 2013 = &lt;pre>Developing developers	I've had the privilege to work with a number of young devs over the years, and helped develop their skills. When it really clicks there's a lot of learning going on, all around. And the combination of a graybeard and young turk as a devteam has a lot of things going for it. 	It's probably a lot like Mike Woodson working with Carmelo or Ray Felton or JR Smith. Only the older programmer can still do it, if the mind is willing. It's like directing movies as well as basketball.		I know &amp;lt;a href="http://nakedjen.blogs.com/">NakedJen&amp;lt;/a> who loves both basketball and movies will understand this. :-)		BTW, when NJ came to visit in December, I knew she loved movies, but I had no idea about basketball. How did &amp;lt;i>that&amp;lt;/i> happen? 	In tech, however -- we set those young talented people out to conquer the world on their own. Their coaches, unlike basketball players, aren't developers. So they don't know what to tell them. 	No wonder we make so little progress from generation to generation.	I'd really like to change this. NYT open newsroom to bloggers	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/30/soccerball.gif" width="125" height="125" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named ball.gif">The NYT just &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/timespace/">announced&amp;lt;/a> that they're opening up their newsroom to a few tech startups. It's a fun idea, but also a safe one. If I were starting something I wouldn't want to put my office in the NYT. That's a gimmick. Running a startup is noisy and messy and sometimes involves firing people, and major disappointments, and you really want to hide the messy stuff from reporters. Even small companies, real ones, care about the press they get. Which leads me to conclude there aren't going to be many heavy duty companies in the group they pick.	Then it hit me. The Times could do something not only courageous, but revolutionary for news. Give the space to bloggers. Qualify them the way you're qualifying the startups. Show us your blog. We'd like to read it. If we think it's interesting (and don't go for safety) and &amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/30/soccerball.gif" width="125" height="125" border="0" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named soccerball.gif"> there's a reason it could benefit from locating both in midtown and/or the NYT offices, and we think the work you do would be stimulating for us, here's some space for six months.	They will never do it, but if they did, with their hearts in it, the NYT and news in general, would change much faster than it is changing. In my opinion, for the better. They won't do it because it's competition and they're scared they'll end up doing what bloggers do. But the sooner they do more of what bloggers do the sooner they can get on with it. That means not worrying what their sources think of them, and report the news like real people instead of people in an ivory tower. Get out there and do it. And if you aren't doing it, then bring it in. A joke Rudy Kiesler might have told	A rabbi, walking down the street in NY, sees a sign. 	Moishe Teitelbaum Chinese Laundry. 	Puzzled, he goes inside. An old Chinese man stands behind the counter. 	"Do you own this laundry?" the rabbi asks. Yes. 	"And your name is Moishe Teitelbaum?" Yes. 	"If you don't mind my asking, how did you come by such a name?"	"When I came through Ellis Island, the man before me said his name was Moishe Teitelbaum. 	"When my turn came, the man asked my name and I said Sam Ting."		&amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/576320790/">Rudy Kiesler&amp;lt;/a> was my grandfather. He came from the Old Country. 		This joke first &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/2000/04/20.html">appeared&amp;lt;/a> on Scripting News in 2000.Javascript w/o curly braces	Python doesn't have curly braces and semicolons because it considers the structure of the source code syntactically significant. We have something similar working with Javascript. Because I edit my code in an outliner, I have the curly braces and semicolons added as the text is generated from the outline. The result is a cleaner looking JS code, and less syntax to worry about. 	Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/28/opmlsource.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a> of what the code looks like w/o the CBASs. And the same code in a &amp;lt;a href="http://hellotrex.blorkmark.com/">web page&amp;lt;/a>, after they have been generated. As you can see it's functional.	This is possible because JS is consistent about its use of structural symbols. And the structure of the language maps well on outline structure. Not perfectly, but enough to make it worth using.		The difficult construct is if-then-else. All other statements have a single summit but it has two.	It's not ready for other people to use yet but it will be soon, Murphy-willing! :-)	Update: This capability is now &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.scripting.com/january2013/12913ByDw/newJavascriptNodetype">available&amp;lt;/a> in the worldoutline software, released today.Vine is interesting	I was on the subway last night coming home from a Nets game in Brooklyn and I thought to take out my iPod and do a &amp;lt;a href="http://boston.com/business/innovation/blogs/inside-the-hive/2013/01/28/twitter-vine-leaves-boston-crawling-with-goofy-short-videos/sZXCeX77gRc2JzvaX9tkAM/blog.html">Vine&amp;lt;/a> video between two stops on the 1 train. It came out great! I couldn't wait to share it when I got out of the subway and had a net connection. But when I got out, it was gone. Whoa. That sucks.

Consider this a bug report. ;-)Beautiful software	Jason Pontin of Tech Review &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jason_pontin/status/295919343894667264">asked&amp;lt;/a> a challenging question on Twitter today. What's the most beautiful software? 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/28/mona.gif" width="65" height="88" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named mona.gif">I answered his challenge with a podcast. I felt the idea needed verbal explanation. I offered three examples. Two written by others, and one I wrote myself. In every case it's the reflection of the software from another person that makes the beauty evident. That, to me, is what art is. It is in the experiencing of it. 	If the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa">Mona Lisa&amp;lt;/a> hung in a locked closet where no one could see it, it would not be art. Anything that evokes a response from an observer &amp;lt;i>is&amp;lt;/i> art. And the beauty is a function of the experience. Beauty isn't intrinsic to the thing itself, as I illustrate in the story I tell.	So here's the podcast.	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/myReallySimple/2013/01/28/davecast2013jan28.m4a">http://static.scripting.com/myReallySimple/2013/01/28/davecast2013jan28.m4a&amp;lt;/a>	DaveThe best commercial ever!	&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9H0xPWAtaa8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	I bet they play this one in Colorado and Washington State. :-)	Yah man!!This is a test	For the next sixty seconds this station will conduct a test of the emergency blogcast system.	Here, have a nice bagel!		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/28/bagel.gif" width="193" height="192" border="0" alt="A picture named bagel.gif">What early software was influential?	On Thursday I wrote a &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/january/whatAboutMacwriteAndMacpaint">piece&amp;lt;/a> about MacWrite and MacPaint, two pieces of software that influenced much if not all the software that followed. There are many other examples of seminal software products. In most cases, the products are not the first of its kind, as MacWrite was not the first word processor, but for whatever reason, put enough of the pieces together to lead the way to the future. It's not always obvious in the moment, but with the benefit of hindsight we can see.	They don't, for some reason, study these products in computer science. They fall between the cracks of "serious" study of algorithms and data structures, and user interface and user experience (which still is not much-studied, but at least is starting). This is more the history of software. Much like the history of film, or the history of rock and roll. 	In film, the movies of the 1930s were unusually influential. Probably because it was the first decade of sound. 	In popular music, the sixties and early seventies were seminal. The music of a very small number of artists and bands took music in a new direction. 	It seems to me that the 1980s were like that for software. Before that, serious people dismissed the idea that ordinary people would use computers. You know, the clip from the Steve Jobs movie where fictitious Woz says no one will ever use this stuff. People believed that (not Woz, he's always been a visionary and an inclusionist, the movie did him a disservice). To be a believer meant being lonely. That is, until we all read Ted Nelson's book! So, if we were to make a list of art that led to the popular use of computers, Nelson's work would surely be in there. As would Woz and Jobs, and Bill Atkinson, Randy Wiggington and Susan Kare, who pioneered a little thing like graphic icons. Made a huge difference, and influenced software design for all who came after.	And Unix, sparse, bare-bones and character-based was also hugely influential. In the commercial software world it lay dormant during the 80s, mostly used in academia. But the seed was planted. If you got a compsci education in the late 70s or 80s you used Unix. And then, in the early 90s when networking boomed, it was Unix it boomed around. It became the server platform. The web basically is Unix with a somewhat friendly interface slapped on it (said with a bit of irony). I never thought users would tolerate &amp;lt;i>http://&amp;lt;/i> but it shows how wrong you can be (an idea always worth considering).	Other obvious products of the 80s whose influence are still felt today (and remember this is my list, not anyone else's): Visicalc, Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel in spreadsheets. The popular word processors and databases of the day. PowerPoint. The Finder. Hypercard. 	I had to start a separate paragraph for two long-gone and much-missed products: Think C and Turbo Pascal. I used the former, for quite some time, to develop serious software. It did something no one thought was possible -- instant compiles of huge C programs. This was a barrier that was broken by Turbo Pascal a few years earlier. Proves one of the fundamental rules of good software design -- always revisit your assumptions as time goes by and Moore's Law continues to change the rules of hardware. What you couldn't do a few years ago might work perfectly well today. 	As I played around with this idea, I started thinking of people whose opinions I would value on this, and then realized this was turning into a software Hall of Fame, like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Something that the movie business doesn't do and should imho -- go back twenty or thirty years and recognize the films they missed when they were new, but turned out to be seminal. Honor people who you didn't know were great when they made their early contributions. 	I would ask people like Woz, Ray Ozzie, Dan Bricklin, Mitch Kapor, Joel Spolsky, Marc Canter, Michael Miller (former editor of PC and InfoWorld and a walking encyclopedia of software), Jon Udell, Chuck Shotton (people you might not have heard of but who have great depth of knowledge). Robert Carr and Greg Stikeleather. I'd love to ask Brendan Eich what languages influenced the design of Javascript. Or ask TBL what software he was using in the years leading up to the web. What software was Jimmy Wales studying before he figured out that we needed a global open encyclopedia? What led Adam Curry to come up with the idea for the "last yard" -- the idea that led to podcasting? Who else? Here's a chance for us graybeard programmer types to help put things in perspective. 	For my programmer friend who wanted to know about MacWrite and MacPaint, I suggested watching James Burke's great Connections series, which I've &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+james+burke+connections">written&amp;lt;/a> about previously. Every "invention" is more of a synthesis of ideas that were floating around. This is the brilliance that makes change possible. If we had our priorities straight we wouldn't honor the lone inventor (an idea that I don't think even exists) rather we'd celebrate the synthesizer, the Rolling Stones, who loved the music of American blues musicians and figured out how to make it relevant to everyone, but never forgot their roots. Just one of a billion examples.	Perhaps we're ready to give up the mythology of tech innovation, and start studying how forward motion really happens.MacWrite and MacPaint, a coral reef	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/24/macwriteLarge.gif">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/24/macwrite.gif" width="140" height="94" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named macwrite.gif">&amp;lt;/a>I was talking yesterday with a programmer friend who is 28. I wanted to use an example, but first wanted to be sure he knew about it. I asked if he knew what &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite">MacWrite&amp;lt;/a> and &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint">MacPaint&amp;lt;/a> was. He said no. 	Now this is very smart, well-educated guy. He has a computer science degree. Asking whether he knew about MacWrite and MacPaint, imho, is like asking a person with an English lit degree if he's heard of Shakespeare. In other words, we have to work on this. :-)	Anyway, I figure a fair number of people who read this blog are like my friend. You might not know about these two seminal products, and you should. 	MacWrite and MacPaint were the only two apps that shipped on the original Mac when it was released on January 24, 1984.	The Mac was a new platform. It didn't run Apple II software or IBM PC software, or even software from its cousin, the Lisa, which shipped from Apple a year earlier. The Mac platform was a completely clean slate. So if you bought a Mac in January or February, or even March or April --  all you could do with it was write with MacWrite and paint with MacPaint. 	They were not very powerful. Each could only open one document at a time. The menus were short. They were limited but they were also something of a miracle, because very few people had ever used a graphic app before. They had graphic menus, worked with a mouse, and they used a lot of pixels, for the day at least. It felt amazing to use these apps. Like driving a very sleek and fancy car. That is, compared to the tools that we were using before. 		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/24/macPaintLarge.gif" width="610" height="407" border="0" alt="A picture named macPaintLarge.gif">	More important, they served as example-ware for the developers of the day. If you were working on Mac apps, as we were at &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext">Living Videotext&amp;lt;/a>, if you wanted to see how to do something, you could always look at one of these two apps for an idea. 	Had the Mac shipped without MacWrite and MacPaint, it's kind of doubtful that there would be a Mac today. Or it might exist but there would be little consistency among the apps. The window I'm typing this blog post into now looks an awful lot like the window we typed into in MacWrite, 29 years ago. 	Software evolves like a coral reef. I've written about this &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+coral+reef">many times&amp;lt;/a>. Something happens, a ship sinks, some fish live in the wreck. Their predators come there too, because there's food to eat. Then they die and their skeletons form a new structure for life to cling to. Eventually you have a thriving ecosystem. No one uses MacWrite or MacPaint today, but in a sense we all do, all the time. 	Someone who is planning on spending a career making software should know all they can about these two very important apps. 	PS: When I write these pieces I feel like Tom Hanks in the final scene of Cloud Atlas. No spoilers. :-)Quora is a blogging platform?	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/23/accordionGuy.gif" width="81" height="194" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named accordionGuy.gif">I just heard that Quora is &amp;lt;a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/01/23/quora-turns-itself-into-a-blogging-platform-are-you-swooning-yet-marketers/">repositioning&amp;lt;/a> as a blogging platform. That's (might be) very cool.	Hopefully that means that they're going to support the APIs that blogging platforms support. That would include the Blogger API and the MetaWeblog API. And of course we'll be looking for the RSS feeds as well.		Update: They &amp;lt;i>do&amp;lt;/i> have RSS feeds. Here's &amp;lt;a href="http://techconstine.quora.com/rss">one&amp;lt;/a>. 		Update: I created my &amp;lt;a href="http://davew.quora.com/Im-dreaming-of-a-White-Christmas">own blog&amp;lt;/a> on Quora.

Here are some of the choices.		WordPress		Tumblr	Uhh that might be it. :-)	If you have any more info please post a comment here. 	&amp;lt;i>Thanks!&amp;lt;/i>	PS: I suggested just &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/05/16/quickIdeaForQuora.html">this move&amp;lt;/a> in May 2012.Preserving the early blogosphere	A story in a list.	1. I love archive.org. It's essential. Without it, we would have absolutely no record of the early sites that are gone. Hooray for &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle">Brewster Kahle&amp;lt;/a>. No sarcasm. He should get a &amp;lt;a href="http://amturing.acm.org/">Turing Award&amp;lt;/a>. Researchers of the future will praise him, and rightfully so, for having the foresight and will to provide an archive of so much of the early web.	2. If you want to see how necessary it is, spend a few minutes clicking on links from the &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=archive">archive&amp;lt;/a> of this blog from the 1990s. Most of the items I linked to are gone. The only way to see the content they once pointed to is to go to archive.org.		I picked one random month, &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/1998/06.html">June 1998&amp;lt;/a>. Very depressing. All the links to DaveNet pieces in that month, for example, are broken. Oy. After a little investigation it's clear why. Umpteen migrations later, and in all that a dependency on .htaccess files. However S3 does not understand .htaccess files. Oh well. Not easily fixable in a few minutes. But the data is still there. You just have to know where to find it.		Who's the best? It looks like the NY Times. All their links still work. They have some amazing future-thinking people there, and they mean business. Good work.	3. However, sometimes that doesn't work, because the archive is imperfect. Sometimes the sites had bugs, and saw the archive.org crawler as a denial-of-service attack. A large number of UserLand-hosted sites are missing from archive.org for that reason. It was our fault, but in our defense, we were fighting fires with a very small staff and a company that was perpetually running out of money. Yet, we had as one of our goals to preserve the content we were hosting. Luckily most, but not all of our sites are still accessible at their original addresses. (See #6 below to learn why, it's not an accident.)	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/22/appleMusiciansBig.gif">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/22/appleMusicians.gif" width="145" height="94" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named appleMusicians.gif">&amp;lt;/a>4. As the blogging art progressed, we realized we should be creating static content. That would make it easier to archive. So we were able to find a home for the Radio UserLand &amp;lt;a href="http://radio-weblogs.com/">community&amp;lt;/a>, with Matt Mullenweg. He has a similar problem for WordPress sites, and Matt is young, and likely to be around longer than I am, so it made sense to trust him with this content. It's not by any means an ideal solution, but it's good enough. And I do trust Matt. He has a good heart and sees a big picture. I think he values history as much as I do.	5. We had a scare with the &amp;lt;a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0 spec&amp;lt;/a>. It went offline in a server upgrade at Harvard a couple of years after I gave the spec to them, hoping it would survive longer there than on UserLand's servers. I learned a lot from the experience of trying to future-safe it. It's been at its current location for almost ten years. So I'm fairly optimistic that it will survive for a while longer. :-)	6. I am hosting a large part of the archive from UserLand and scripting.com. Jake Savin, a former UserLand guy is hosting the other large part, out of the goodness of his heart, and respecting our early mission to produce a record. Both of us are looking for a way to make this stuff much more safe than it currently is. 	7. Not to be dramatic or anything, but no more than 40 days after I die, and probably much sooner, all of the content I'm hosting will disappear. That's just not acceptable. What was the point of trying to save it if that's the best we can do. (And after I'm gone it isn't my problem anymore.)	8. I'm looking to create new art for long-lived websites. I see this as more of a financial and organizational problem than a technical one. From a technical standpoint, the best approach are static files served by any software capable of serving folders of static files. I like Apache. The domains should continue to work. 	9. More people would then create new content in this format, so that there will be no need to archive the sites. There should be the idea of content that's designed to survive as long as the web survives. This is especially important for sites that are trying to create a record. Government and news sites. Researchers who want their work to be built on in the future. Writers who think their ideas might be meaningful in a future context. Basically, anything that isn't completely ephemeral. We complain that the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content">UGC&amp;lt;/a> companies aren't doing a good job of preserving their archives. But the awful truth is that no one is. The web is very very fragile. We can and should be making an investment in making it stronger and more resistent to damage. 	10. Right now the archive of the early blogosphere is in an unknown state. There were sites at Blogger, Movable Type, we hosted some at EditThisPage.com, and weblogs.com. I would like to see all of it safe and ready for future readers and researchers. Not as museum exhibits (this is what an ancient blog looked like) but as &amp;lt;i>literature&amp;lt;/i> that's available to anyone at any time. There probably were some great writers back then, and there certainly is history that we have already lost that can be resurrected. But every day that gets harder. We should do something about this.	I am mentioning this now because it's a long-term objective. I hope to be around for a while to work on this with others, hopefully younger people, who have a longer horizon than I do. I'm not looking for anything like a quick solution, because this is a problem that took many years to create. But I want to start making things better, one step at a time. I will go to conferences, if necessary -- but only conferences that are about preserving the early blogopshere. I am in favor of preserving everything, but one person can't take on everything. :-)Outage theater	It appears Twitter is down.	This is like using candles or hanging out at a camp fire?	If you have anything to say, leave a comment &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/january/outageTheater">here&amp;lt;/a>, or on &amp;lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5094389">Hacker News&amp;lt;/a>.Two post-season TV ads	Football post-season ads are grand.	Two ads during the NFC championship, one from Apple, the other from Google. Both are selling the same product. One wins, the other a loser.	Apple has a protagonist playing ping pong with the Williams tennis sisters. They're very pretty. The ad is selling a feature of an iPhone that lets you tell it to STFU because you're sleeping. Aha. You're having a sexy dream with the Williams sisters. Do Not Disturb.	A mom reading to her baby daughter on a couch. The little girl is having a fantasy, involving the tablet computer. Completely unnecessary. At the end of the ad you see that the mom is reading the story from a tablet. Nexus. What? Not Apple. Fuck.	Apple is ceding the high ground to Google. Doc on life as a race	Yesterday at &amp;lt;a href="http://www.rememberaaronsw.com/">Aaron's memorial&amp;lt;/a> in NYC, Doc Searls said:		When you're young you think life is a sprint. 		When you're older you see it's a marathon. 		And when you're mature you see it's a relay race.We expect too much of geeks	I've been a developer since I was 19 years old. That's already 38 years. I went to Silicon Valley when I was 25, and immediately met the most powerful people in the Valley. It was like that then, and still is -- if you're bright and young, male, strong, assertive, confident and optimistic, you can have access. Probably a lot like sport, basketball, baseball, etc. If you're young and think you're hot shit, and there's some reason to believe you are, you can go far, very quickly. This has been going on for as long as I've been in tech, and long before that. 	Computers are amazing things, they really are, in ways most non-technical people aren't even aware of. For example, when I learned about the process of bootstrapping compilers I was blown away. Still am actually. I tried explaining it to everyone I knew who wasn't a programmer. The only person who got it, sort of, was my uncle, a mechanical engineer. He could see using a hammer to make a hammer, so what's the big deal. How about using a specific hammer to make itself? How about that! His eyes glazed over. Yours probably are too. But ask someone who has made a real life compiler and see how mystical they get. 	So we programmers in a sense are a secret society. Until you learn the handshake you aren't one of us. And we can be pretty arrogant about it. Until the computer kicks our ass. Or the market. Or users. Then we learn really quickly that what we learned in school was just the beginning. That when we thought we understood everything that was just the arrogance of youth. It's functional. Because how else could you take on the world if you understood how huge and complex and fucked up the world actually is! :-)	This is when depression sets in. All of a sudden you see that you are not all-powerful, you can't handle everything the world throws at you. But then what do you do if you've told everyone you can deal with it, that you'll come out on top? When I got to that point, which I remember very clearly, I felt I couldn't possibly face failure. I was locking up the office of Living Videotext one night, knowing the next day I would be firing half the company, and having no idea how we were going to bail it out. Yes, you can get lower than that. But between the two paths, one up and the other down, there wasn't much margin for error. 	When young people risk it all, it would be nice if there were people who understood what they're going through, who could offer some perspective. Even better, if there was an oldtimer around when the world is telling you you're a god and can do no wrong, to tell you that's bullshit, to kick you in the butt, in a friendly way, tell you you're a mortal human being, and you need to understand that life has its ups and downs, and you're going to be around for a long time, and this is just the beginning, part of the learning process, and while it looks like everything is great now, or falling apart, or whatever emotion is driving you at this moment, let's go for a walk, get a burger, see a movie and hang out for a bit, watch a game, and notice all the other stuff that's going on.	Whew. That took a lot to write.	The other thing we all can do, if we love the product of technical minds, is stop thinking it's magic. There is magic in computers, but the magic isn't in the programmer or the tech writer or the visionary -- it's in the whole thing. The miracle isn't any one person, rather it's that humanity can collaborate to create something &amp;lt;i>much&amp;lt;/i> greater than any one of us. Then we can all have an accurate perspective on our role in it. 		&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/myyWXKeBsNk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>Repubs and the Beetlejuice football players	There's a group of football players in the wonderful Tim Burton movie &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice&amp;lt;/a>, one of whom delivers a great line, which &amp;lt;a href="http://www.hark.com/beetlejuice/coach-i-dont-think-we-survived-that-crash">goes&amp;lt;/a> as follows. "Hey coach, I don't think we survived that crash." I don't to spoil it any more than I have to, but it's funny in the context it's delivered in. :-)	I was reminded of this line when I read about the House Republicans finally &amp;lt;a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2013/01/19/house_republicans_start_acting_like_theyre_in_minority.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PoliticalWire+%28Political+Wire%29">realizing&amp;lt;/a> that they are the minority party. It's as if Cantor said to Boehnoer "Hey boss, I don't think we survived the election."	Now maybe we can resume having some semblance of government, the voters having spoken, and finally the Republicans having heard.Why I write	I get a fair amount of grief for writing my blog and pushing links through my feed and to Twitter. It's been this way since before I started blogging. There are always people around who question your motives, and who project their own nasty theories about people on the easiest target to find. Often that's the most vocal and visible person, esp one without affiliation. There always seems to be one person who has a bone to pick with me, sometimes &amp;lt;i>lots&amp;lt;/i> of people. 	There are many reasons I write, but probably the least of it is for fame or fortune. I don't make much money writing, I actually &amp;lt;i>spend&amp;lt;/i> money to write. And if I wanted fame there are much more direct ways to go about it. In fact over the years, I've done things to limit my fame, because I don't like being famous. 	I write to express myself, and to learn. Writing is a form of processing my ideas. When I tell a story verbally a few times, I'm ready to write it. After writing it, I understand the subject even better.	I send links to Twitter and to my linkblog feed because I want to share them, and because I want to remember them. By linking to them they get into my archive where I can search. This way instead of hunting around for an article, trying to remember where it was or how I got there, instead I just scroll through the archive. As a by-product, I share it. Some people like this. I assume the people who don't like it know how to unsub.	I also write to create a record. In my programming work I've gotten a lot more disciplined about this. I have a rule that I can't make a change to my most mature products, the ones that are being used by others, without posting a worknote. It's a rule I don't have any trouble keeping, even though at the beginning, it was like a New Years resolution, it felt like a chore. Now it's a habit as ingrained as brushing my teeth or taking my meds or getting exercise every day. I don't feel right if I don't do it -- so I do.	I write to keep up the connection with people I care about. That way when we meet, they have a clue what's going on with me. I really like it when people I care about blog too, so its reciprocal.	I write to put a stake in the ground, so I can, over time, debug my prediction process, and hone my understanding of how things work. If you point to something I wrote ten years ago that turned out wrong, I don't feel ashamed. I take the opportunity to learn. By explaining my process then, I have a chance to debug it later. Why did I think desktop publishing was a bad idea? I don't know -- because I didn't write about it. But I do know why I thought the iPhone was a bad idea. This process helps me get smarter over time. 	I write to give people something to react to. So you think the iPhone was a winner from Day One. Great. Tell me why. Maybe I'll change my mind. It's happened more than once that a commenter here showed me another way of thinking about something and I eventually came around to their point of view. And even if I don't change my mind, it's helpful to understand how another person, given the same set of facts, can arrive at a different conclusion. 	Update: Another reason I write, which I remembered after publishing -- I develop writing tools. If I didn't write, I couldn't do that. I wouldn't be able to test them, refine them, and get new ideas for new tools. Writing and my software development process are integral. I couldn't do one without the other.	And maybe I write because I'm narcissistic. It's possible. You know it's hard to tell, because the only experience we have is our own. I don't know what you think, unless you tell me, and then I have to decide if you're being honest about it, or being honest with yourself. And I try not to worry about that so much. Because whether you're honest or not is something for you to deal with, and if there is a god, for he or she to judge you on. It's not my problem, thankfully. Because there are now 7 billion people on the planet. If we were to make each person's honesty our business, we'd have no time to live! :-)	So when someone gets on a soapbox and starts trying to rev up a crowd to hate me, and when they lie to do it, I have to learn not to give that any weight. What I do now is ask a friend to have a look and tell me what they see. Since the ranting isn't about them, they won't take it personally. If they say it's something I should pay attention to, I would -- but they never do. The most recent time it happened, a friend came back and said the person is a sadist. But my mind still circles around the abuse. I have a hard time not thinking about it. So what do I do? Write about it, of course. Now it's on the web, and hopefully out of my way.	One more thing. I remember being at a conference, chatting with someone and I saw at the other end of the room someone who had been a friend but had started trashing me on the Internet. I excused myself and walked over to the guy and sat down next to him, and asked why he was doing it. He started repeating the nonsense he was saying online. But I didn't think he really believed it, so I pressed him and asked why he was &amp;lt;i>really&amp;lt;/i> doing it. He said he had cancer, and was in chemo, and was in a lot of pain. I felt sick myself in that moment. I said you know that's terrible, but it's no reason to do and say things that hurt me, and make me feel bad. We all have our struggles. Me too. He agreed, and we're friends again, but now when I see him online, I can't forget how &amp;lt;i>used&amp;lt;/i> I was, and why, and the pain comes back, his pain and mine. This really sucks. 	Anyway, I don't know why people do this. I don't think I will ever be immune to it. But I find that having good loyal friends helps make it a bit more tolerable.NBA All-star Results	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule level="1" to="2">			&amp;lt;font-weight>bold&amp;lt;/font-weight>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	Eastern Conference		Frontcourt			LeBron James (Mia) 1,583,646			Carmelo Anthony (NYK) 1,460,950			Kevin Garnett (Bos) 553,222			Chris Bosh (Mia) 528,014			Tyson Chandler (NYK) 467,968			Paul Pierce (Bos) 294,213			Joakim Noah (Chi) 230,796			Josh Smith (Atl) 187,174			Shane Battier (Mia) 151,877			Anderson Varejao (Cle) 149,246			Amar'e Stoudemire (NYK) 147,720			Luol Deng (Chi) 130,744			Andrew Bynum (Phi) 111,902			Brook Lopez (BKN) 108,978			Jeff Green (Bos) 91,356		Backcourt			Dwyane Wade (Mia) 1,052,310			Rajon Rondo (Bos) 924,180			Deron Williams (BKN) 449,791			Kyrie Irving (Cle) 445,730			Ray Allen (Mia) 326,186			Monta Ellis (Mil) 123,096			Raymond Felton (NYK) 105,340			Jrue Holiday (Phi) 103,146			Jason Terry (Bos) 88,708			Paul George (Ind) 80,060	Western Conference		Frontcourt			Kevin Durant (OKC) 1,504,047			Dwight Howard (LAL) 922,070			Blake Griffin (LAC) 863,832			Tim Duncan (SA) 492,373			Pau Gasol (LAL) 310,845			Kevin Love (Min) 283,458			Omer Asik (Hou) 240,467			Serge Ibaka (OKC) 197,063			Rudy Gay (Mem) 182,523			David Lee (GS) 165,875			LaMarcus Aldridge (Por) 160,197			Marc Gasol (Mem) 153,459			Zach Randolph (Mem) 146,980			Dirk Nowitzki (Dal) 145,776			Chandler Parsons (Hou) 144,697		Backcourt			Kobe Bryant (LAL) 1,591,437			Chris Paul (LAC) 929,155			Jeremy Lin (Hou) 883,809			James Harden (Hou) 485,986			Russell Westbrook (OKC) 376,411			Steve Nash (LAL) 270,741			Tony Parker (SA) 176,168			Stephen Curry (GS) 169,083			Ricky Rubio (Min) 150,227			Manu Ginobili (SA) 118,293My icons feed	I've been having fun with icons on Twitter, mixing things up, same way I put images in the right margin of &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News&amp;lt;/a>.	Peter Rojas of gdgt had an &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peterrojas/status/291956766831423490">interesting idea&amp;lt;/a>.

They were go-go times, like now, but we weren't raising the kind of money people raise now. Vendors wanted to participate in the boom, so often you could work out deals for stock from people who printed your packaging, or did contract work. I'm still okay with that, however, not for lawyers.	In a way it's counter-intuitive. Why wouldn't you want your lawyer to be incentivized for your success? 	The answer is, sure it's great -- when incentives are what it's about. But maybe the company won't be the shooting rocket everyone thinks? Maybe there are tough times ahead? Could happen. And then you'll have one shareholder with a huge advantage over everyone else. He or she will have set up the company. If there's any kind of shareholder action, the lawyer is going to have a big advantage over everyone else.	So pay your lawyer in cash, not stock. Keep them on your side. Everyone will be happier.Gamify the NY Times	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/16/monopolyMan.gif" width="145" height="197" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named monopolyMan.gif">The word &amp;lt;i>gamify&amp;lt;/i> is kind of weird but nice. 	It &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+gamify">means&amp;lt;/a> to take something that isn't a game and give it game-like features. 	Twitter is gamified because it &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/16/twitterShowsFollowers.gif">shows&amp;lt;/a> you how many followers people have.	It seems the NYT could benefit from a little of that. 	How might it work?	1. Everyone starts out with 10 free article reads per month. As it works right now.	2. When I tweet a link to a piece on the NYT site, I get my own code, so they can tell that a hit came from me. For every 100 clicks, I get another free read. 	3. That way we can put aside all that michegas about 99 cents for 8 weeks, which seems pretty crass, because I'm a veritable flow machine for the Times. Or at least I would be if they would gamify. :-)	What do you think?	PS: They can give us twice the reads for traffic generated for competitive articles, ones where they want to beat out the WaPo, BBC etc. And when the NYT gets their own Twitter-like system, which they will have to do someday if they want to stay independent, they can offer triple-points there, to encourage use of that system.We should retire Aaron's number	When a great &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_retired_numbers">baseball&amp;lt;/a> or &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_retired_jersey_numbers">basketball&amp;lt;/a> player leaves the game they &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retired_number">retire&amp;lt;/a> his or her number. That means the jersey hangs from the ceiling, or there's a &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Monument_Park.JPG">plaque&amp;lt;/a> at the stadium, and no player on the team ever wears that number again. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth">Babe Ruth's&amp;lt;/a> number, 3, is retired. &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan">Michael Jordan's&amp;lt;/a> too (23). Jackie Robinson's &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_retired_numbers#Number_retired_by_Major_League_Baseball">number&amp;lt;/a>, 42, is retired for all baseball teams.	On the web, retiring a number would mean the website is permanently registered, and the content is preserved so it lasts as long as the web does. That means the contents of &amp;lt;a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">aaronsw.com&amp;lt;/a> will be there forever. It will never become a porn site, or a landing page, or whatever. 	Right now there is no way to do this. Isn't that strange. We could fix it if we want. The Internet is just software. It would be a small but worthwhile hack and could set a precedent for future memorials. 	Something to think about!	Update: There's an active &amp;lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5064923">Hacker News thread&amp;lt;/a> on this topic. Aaron Swartz was curious	Like everyone else in the part of the web that I exist in, I've been reading lots of stuff about Aaron Swartz over the last few days. The stuff written by professional reporters are mostly vain attempts to explain something they don't understand. Even the ones who have been covering tech for a long time miss what's important. Imho. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3004769/my-email-exchange-aaron-swartz-shows-original-thinker">I read one piece&amp;lt;/a>, written by Aaron himself and published in Fast Company yesterday, that really nailed it, about who he was. It was in the form of an email he had written to Ronald Lemos of Creative Commons Brazil, explaining, among other things, his involvement with RSS.	He said he had been writing web apps, after visiting Philip Greenspun's web class at MIT, and trying to make reading news sites more automatic. Sounds about right. That's the frustration I was dealing with too, but I didn't know Aaron at the time. He says that then, when the RSS 1.0 effort became visible, he immediately wanted to be involved. That's when our paths crossed for the first time. You can read all about it in the &amp;lt;a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/messages/1?l=1">archive&amp;lt;/a> of the &amp;lt;a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/">RSS-DEV&amp;lt;/a> mail list on Yahoo Groups. Here's the &amp;lt;a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/message/2">first message&amp;lt;/a> Aaron posted. It was the second message of the group.		To the extent that I participated, it was to express my dismay that this format was incompatible with what we were using. I didn't think they should call it RSS, because that would add confusion. Of course that's ancient history. But people have asked why they don't see my name on that spec. That's why.	Aaron explains that what made him unique was that he was curious. 		"When I was a kid, I thought a lot about what made me different from the other kids. I don't think I was smarter than them and I certainly wasn't more talented. And I definitely can't claim I was a harder worker -- I've never worked particularly hard, I've always just tried doing things I find fun. Instead, what I concluded was that I was more curious -- but not because I had been born that way. If you watch little kids, they are intensely curious, always exploring and trying to figure out how things work. The problem is that school drives all that curiosity out. Instead of letting you explore things for yourself, it tells you that you have to read these particular books and answer these particular questions. And if you try to do something else instead, you'll get in trouble. Very few people's curiosity can survive that. But, due to some accident, mine did. I kept being curious and just followed my curiosity."	After spending a lot of time in the last few days reading about his intellectual explorations, I'd agree. He nailed it. That &amp;lt;i>is&amp;lt;/i> what made him unique. And that's of course a great thing. The world would be a better place if more people were driven by curiosity. Too many people accept things as they are. Aaron wanted to know why things worked the way they did, and wanted to see if there were other ways that might work better. 	Amen and right on Aaron, who now belongs to eternity. We'll try our best down here on earth to remain curious and keep following where it leads.	Thanks! :-)Adoption, not invention	Lots of stuff gets invented that never makes a difference. 	Invention isn't the important moment with any format or protocol. 	The moment that's important is adoption. If it got adopted then we call it "good enough" and go on. 	In RSS, the moment of adoption came when the NY Times published feeds in RSS 2.0 format in 2002. That got the users going, and gave other pubs something to shoot at. Blogging software already supported the format. We were off to the races. 	Also, a lot of the early users were reporters and editors, which drove the need for other pubs to get on board. If all the users had been in some other profession, the uptake might not have been so quick or large	It wasn't an act of invention, or even design -- it was adoption and then uptake that make RSS as a format significant.	Technologists and reporters should understand this is a process, not a moment. 	Hopefully that sheds some light on a subject that now seems to be interesting to people, which imho is a good thing.	And obviously all this is just my own opinion. Like a guy whose been around a sport for a long time and thinks he understands what makes it tick. Not presented as anything other than that. :-)Online grieving	When I went to my grandmother's funeral, in Rockaway, in 1977, I was surprised at how people were laughing and exchanging gossip. It was a family event. She died young, at 66, so the family was still pretty large. My grandfather was there, even though they were divorced. I knew her pretty well, and I don't think she would have approved all the laughter. But dead people are dead. A funeral can be the place where that fact sinks in for the first time, and people are entitled to express themselves however they want. As long as it doesn't interfere with others expressing themselves, in their own ways.	When my uncle died, her son, many years later, I waited a day before &amp;lt;a href="http://crimson1.scripting.com/kenKiesler">writing&amp;lt;/a> about his passing. He had been a character on Scripting News, my blog. My uncle, along with Dan Gillmor and Jamis MacNiven, were the first people to use my Manila blogging software while it was in development in 1999. I often pointed to his &amp;lt;a href="http://www.greatvavavoom.com/">site&amp;lt;/a>, and wrote about his adventures in Jamaica. But when he died, I didn't feel I was ready to write about it publicly for a bit of time. Probably because he was so close in age to me, just ten years older. A role model for me. And someone whose death hit me hard. I wanted to learn &amp;lt;i>something&amp;lt;/i> from it before writing about it. At first I was just dazed. Stunned. Speechless. 	Then, when my father died, a number of years after that, I &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/03/fathersDay.html">wrote&amp;lt;/a> about it the day it happened. It was one of the pieces I am most proud of. Short and simple, and deeply truthful. I don't read it very often but when I do, I am reminded of the sadness, of the letting-go, of feelings that had been long held inside, becoming part of the past. In an instant. No longer issues. My father loomed large in my life. But I was ready to write about it because his death was a long time coming. We got a chance to talk about it, me and him. It still haunts me. But I didn't need a lot of time to process it, before I could say what I had to say. 	In family, and online, I've come to respect the way people grieve is different for everyone, as it was for people at my grandmother's funeral, so many years ago. Everyone has a different process, and it could be different every time depending on who-knows-what. Death is something that I find impossible to understand. That's why it's so damned frightening. Maybe it's no more unpleasant than taking a trip. Maybe god is merciful and death is a pleasurable release full of spritual oxytocin. There are reasons to believe this might be so. Maybe death is something that's impossible to experience, much as we have no memory of existence from before conception? Death is a mystery, a horrifying one, if you love life. All the more horrifying if someone reaches a place where death is a choice they make. I find it especially hard to reach any conclusions about that. 	When I was young, the father of the kids across the street, one winter day, killed himself in the basement of the house, with a gun. His son discovered the body. I've had a whole lifetime to process that event, and you know what -- I still don't have any wisdom from it. I don't understand, and my guess is that I never will. And it's &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/290104141513101313">hard&amp;lt;/a> to find anything meaningful to say about something you have no appreciation for.	I knew &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz&amp;lt;/a>, not very well, but I did know him. I spent a fair amount of time yesterday reading &amp;lt;a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/">his blog&amp;lt;/a>. Aaron was a voracious &amp;lt;a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/morebooks">reader&amp;lt;/a>. And he really could write. And his ideas were good. I don't think enough people read his blog. Maybe more will do so now. And to repeat an oft-repeated theme here, maybe we can do something to make sure that his blog remains online as long as there is a web, which hopefully is quite a long time.	What good can come from his death? I think we have to set more reasonable expectations for our brilliant young people. It's true that Aaron was smart, and had a great capacity to learn. But he was just 26. And for many of the years we knew him, he was much younger. He was very much his age, emotionally, even if he had knowledge beyond his years. To expect so much of such a young person probably puts too big a weight on shoulders that aren't prepared for it. I feel that there's a connection between Aaron's suicide and the suicide of &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Zhitomirskiy">Ilya Zhitomirskiy&amp;lt;/a>, one of the founders of Diaspora, and &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Kan">Gene Kan&amp;lt;/a>, who was one of the developers of Gnutella. 	I've had to deal with my share of death in my life, and one message I get from every one of them, approached from any direction, is that the dead are dead. Expressing love for their memory, support for the person, doesn't have much value, because they are not here to receive it. If you want to do something to honor a loved one's memory, be loving and kind to people who are still alive. That's the best thing you can do, always, every day. 	PS: The shortened URL for this post is &amp;lt;a href="http://2ea.r2.ly/">http://2ea.r2.ly/&amp;lt;/a>. A message?	PPS: I didn't put an image on this post because people have been very harsh about a smiley on a previous post that mentioned Aaron's death.		This is part of what I mean about not judging people's way of expressing grief. 		In some cultures funerals are drunken celebrations with songs and sex. Life-affirming parties to honor a friendly soul who liked to have a little fun every once in a while. 		But the Internet that has gravitated around Aaron's soul is a very stern and gray one. Even puritan. 		No matter. If I feel a sentence needs a smiley, then I'm putting a fucking smiley on it and if you don't like it fuck you. :-)RSS history	People are asking about the history of RSS today because of &amp;lt;a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N61/swartz.html">Aaron's passing&amp;lt;/a>. 	In April 2004 I put together a timeline of the various specs that led to RSS 2.0 being published on the Berkman Center website in 2003.	&amp;lt;a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rssVersionHistory.html">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rssVersionHistory.html&amp;lt;/a>	Hopefully this adds some light! :-)The path to static nirvana	If you're using the new static sites feature on S3 here's something to watch out for.	I decided over the holidays to &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/january/movingScriptingcomToS3">move&amp;lt;/a> scripting.com to a static site running on Amazon S3. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/10/accordionGuy.gif" width="125" height="188" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named accordionGuy.gif">It went pretty well, though uploading a folder with a huge number of files is something that we don't have good tools for with S3. But eventually I got it all up there, using a Firefox plug-in, called &amp;lt;a href="http://www.s3fox.net/">S3Fox Organizer&amp;lt;/a>. I had been using it for years, but forgot about it when I switched to Chrome last year. If you're managing large static S3 sites it's nice to have it around.	Then at the end, I had as a loose-end to do the same for www.scripting.com. I wanted to have it simply redirect to scripting.com from an S3 bucket. I thought this would be a simple matter, but it turned out to be &amp;lt;i>impossible,&amp;lt;/i> leaving me in a tough bind that I'm still in.	The reason I can't do it:		1. Amazon rightly requires that bucket names be unique. 		2. Someone has a &amp;lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.scripting.com/">bucket&amp;lt;/a> named www.scripting.com. Don't ask me why, I have no idea. 		3. Therefore I &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/10/bucketNameNotAvailable.gif">can't have&amp;lt;/a> a bucket named www.scripting.com, even though I registered the domain, a long long time ago. No one has ever had it but me. 	I haven't tried to figure out who it is, but I probably should, and ask them nicely if they could give it up.	Right now I have a dynamic server running on EC2 doing the remap. But &amp;lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/">www.scripting.com&amp;lt;/a> gets a lot of traffic. It's the primary name the site went by until I became a fan of shorter names. :-)Spike Lee -- see Django -- please!	I'm a movie fan, but I am a software guy. Spike Lee is a movie guy and a basketball fan. I know what he thinks about movies and basketball from Twitter, which happens to be the kind of software I make. So I make software that guys like Lee use, and I love movies that guys like Lee make. That's something we have in common. 	As a software guy I encourage people to use software. I'm never going to judge a piece of software without using it. There may be software I don't like but not software I don't like that I haven't used.	&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Unchained">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/09/django.gif" width="145" height="212" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named django.gif">&amp;lt;/a>That's why I wish Spike Lee would go watch Tarantino's movie, Django Unchained. Yes, they say "nigger" a lot. I find myself using the word in my inner conversation a lot after watching the movie (in my head it's Samuel L Jackson's Django character saying it). I don't dare say it out loud, cause I'm white, I guess. I think that kind of sucks, btw. Why can Patti Smith whose music I love sing a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLIkM4wvcC8">song&amp;lt;/a> with nigger in the title, but it's not cool for Tarantino or me to use the word? I don't get it. 		&amp;lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DLIkM4wvcC8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	I honestly don't understand what the problem is. I'd like to understand. Maybe it's that Spike Lee would like to do a movie about slavery but can't get it funded? Surely he doesn't think no movies about slavery should be made? I can't get behind that idea. I think a lot of the BS in this country going on around the Tea Party and all the gun zealotry is all part of the legacy of slavery. We're still living in the country that was founded on slavery. Even right here in New York. (A lot of people don't know that the slave trade came through NYC.)	You know Mississippi is still a shit state. Maybe if more people see the movie they'll understand why it's such shit. It's because their ancestors treated human beings as property. It wasn't that they used a disrespectful word. It was something much worse.	Tarantino is an artist who communicates with audacity, but also with a wink. I saw Inglorious Basterds and laughed at the idea of a bunch of Jewish vigilantes in the American Army in World War II in Nazi Germany. I esp liked that Hitler liked Tarantino movies. And you know what -- I'm Jewish, and while I don't want to try to compare the pain my people feel around those events to the feelings of blacks have around slavery, there is something to be said for looking at these events with more of our senses, from different points of view, and thinking about them in ways different from the ways our ancestors taught us to think about them. 	I just don't support the idea of not listening to the artist because -- because what? I don't even understand what the issue is. A new wordpress.com reader?	It's been about a year since wordpress.com released their RSS reader functionality. 	Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/08/readerscreen.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a> of the reader taken earlier today. And here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://ma.tt/2013/01/2012-at-automattic/">link&amp;lt;/a> to the Matt Mullenweg post where he says a new version is shipping this week. 	If you have an account on wordpress.com, this &amp;lt;a href="http://wordpress.com/#!/read/following/">link&amp;lt;/a> should take you to the reader. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/08/accordionGuy.gif" width="81" height="194" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named accordionGuy.gif">It'd be interesting to speculate on what might be in a new reader. 	1. I have subscribed to several feeds but only one appears to be updating today. That should change after I publish this post, since I am subscribed to this feed.	2. Their UI says that you can subscribe to a blog, but that's confusing -- I have feeds that are not in any way associated with a blog. How can I subscribe to them? (I assume they will accept the URL of a feed, in addition to a blog.)		Update: You &amp;lt;i>can&amp;lt;/i> enter a feed URL.	3. There's a ton of whitespace on the reader page. It's nice to have a little space between items, but it's also nice to get some news on the page too! (Sorry for the sarcasm.)	4. Is there a way to import or export an OPML subscription list? 	5. I would, if I were them, strip the markup from descriptions. When I'm skimming, the markup is disruptive. The goal should be to have every post take exactly the same amount of vertical height, and not very much. They human brain is great at skimming, if you set things up the right way.	6. This is what my ideal for a reader &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave">looks&amp;lt;/a> like. 	7. BTW, I like that they did a river of news, and not a mail-oriented reader. It's the right way to go, imho. AP challenges Twitter with feed ad	I have a lot of thoughts about this development, but first -- to note it.	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.ap.org/Content/Press-Release/2013/AP-provides-sponsored-tweets-during-electronics-show">AP is now running its own ads&amp;lt;/a> in its &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ap">Twitter feed&amp;lt;/a>, to its 1.5 million followers.	The first ads are for Samsung. They don't use Twitter's ad platform. Twitter is sure to object.	A few questions follow from this.	1. How did the AP get 1.5 million followers? Did Twitter promote their feed? If so, it seems Twitter has a legitimate right to the revenue flow from their ad feed. Do they have a contractual right to it? 	2. What happens if Twitter shuts them off as they did with developers? What might a shut-off look like when it comes to a content feed? For developers it meant that their API calls were not handled. 	3. What do other content companies plan to do here? Do you all think of Twitter as another channel for your content flow? Do you have plans to monetize it? Do you envision your paywall, if you have one, ever extending to your Twitter feed?	4. Why is there a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/07/apfrog.gif">picture of a frog&amp;lt;/a> on the AP's Twitter page? :-)	Now, my ready-made answers.	1. Don't put ads in your feed, instead think of your feed as a flow of ads pointing to your content. Put ads on the pages you point to from your feed.	2. Don't depend on Twitter to be a common carrier. They are a media company, like you. You're using a competitor to connect with your readers. This is not a healthy situation.I couldn't watch	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/06/screen.gif" width="145" height="121" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 35px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named screen.gif">I made a point to sit down and try to watch a Sunday morning news show today, but I couldn't make it through five minutes. It's not that I was bored, it wasn't boring. They were just freaking me out. These people have lost their minds. I've never seen it this dysfunctional. It was like watching a very drunk person get behind the wheel and drive away, down &amp;lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/highway-1-san-francisco">Highway 1&amp;lt;/a> north of San Francisco. A windy road 1000 feet up a sheer cliff. At the bottom of the cliff, rocks and sea. Make a wrong turn at the wrong moment and everything goes. Isn't there someone who can take the keys out of their hands? It's so weird. The TWC iPad app	Is anyone else using the &amp;lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twc-tv/id420455839?mt=8">Time-Warner iPad app&amp;lt;/a>?	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/06/santaCoke.gif" width="125" height="199" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named santaCoke.gif">It's surprisingly useful, because it turns your iPad into a remote for the cable box. The remote it comes with is the usual piece of junk. Mine is worse than usual because about half the keys don't work. So to get to channel 48, I have to enter 5 then a 0 and click the downarrow twice. I've learned how to find the most important channels this way, but I can't believe I'm actually willing to do this. 	Then I got the iPad app, and have set up my favorites, and I can just click on the name of the channel I want to go to and the iPad sends a message to TWC's mainframe in the cloud, which then sends a message to my set top box to switch to the channel I just clicked on. It all happens in an instant. Pretty cool.	But last night it stopped working. I get a &amp;lt;i>tune error&amp;lt;/i> message at the top of the screen when I try to switch to any channel. Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8354667579/in/photostream">screen shot&amp;lt;/a> of the error on my iPod. Same app.	Really sucks. I'm putting this out there in case anyone else is having problems or knows what box I have to kick to get this working. I have already recycled the power on everything in sight. Clyde makes Knicks games hum	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/06/frazier.gif" width="161" height="258" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named frazier.gif">You know how I say there's room for something between a tweet and a blog post? Like this one. A simple idea worth a few words, but not too many.	I like watching Knicks games on MSG because one of the guys calling the plays is an ex-NBA superstar, and a really smart guy, who takes his job very seriously -- &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier">Walt Frazier&amp;lt;/a>. 	His narrative, I realized watching the game last night, is what goes through the mind of a player on the court. And because he's so smart and cares so much, it's quite a narrative. He loves the sport, and he loves the players, and he loves great basketball. And while the nature of the job isn't to be overly critical, if you listen carefully you can hear what he doesn't like.

I know this from experience. I got to hang out with my father for a full week when he was in hospice in the week before he died. He was never a big truth-teller. He used to say "Don't truth me and I won't truth you." But that week was different. He had a bunch of things he wanted to get off his chest. He didn't go so far as to forgive anyone, or say things that would make him vulnerable or embarassed. A lifetime of holding back on these things doesn't break in a week, no matter how close you are to death. And it wasn't his fault. He grew up into a world that told men that they had to be strong. And any emotion other than anger would scare the people around him. That such a person would grow a hard impenetrable shell is no surprise. 	I've had the near-death experience myself, twice -- once when I was very young, and once a little over ten years ago. I suppose it's a reason some people find me hard to accept. But it's also the reason, I think, that the people who love me, do. If I presented an image of who they want to see, or who I think they want to see, then it's the image they love, not the person. Now that does &amp;lt;i>not&amp;lt;/i> mean you should tell people what you think all the time in every context. But you can change, and apologize and forgive, at any time, without asking anyone's permission, and without fear of offending. Even if you come in a package that most people don't associate with change, regret or forgiveness. 		&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/O8U8Pkod2n4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	Don't miss the opportunity to clean house and have a great rest of your life, even if you haven't narrowly escaped death. Dynamic forms into Javascript objects?	I have a JavaScript question today.	I have a form with lots of input elements whose names I can't hard-code into the JavaScript.

They take blood, listen to this, look into that. I don't do nearly all they want me to do, but I would &amp;lt;i>like&amp;lt;/i> to do more. I understand there's a connection between how I feel and look, and how long I'll live.	I would do more of it, if it integrated with the rest of my life better. Having to wait for returned calls when ever I have to do something with my doctor's office -- so wasteful. Makes me avoid doing things with them. Why can't we use the new communication tools.	While various professions and industries have changed the way they communicate, doctors and their staff have not. For example, there's an app for the iPad from my pharmacy. When it's time to re-order prescription drugs, I don't have to call anyone, or wade through a voicemail tree, I just click a few buttons on a couple of screens, and the meds are waiting  at the pharmacy down the street.	&amp;lt;i>&amp;lt;b>But&amp;lt;/b>&amp;lt;/i> if for some reason they have to talk to the doctor, it all reverts to faxes and phone tag. The contrast is stark. The doctors themselves probably don't have to deal with it, but they do have to pay for the human beings who implement all the steps manually, when they could do it with websites and email. And their patients have to deal with it too. BTW. :-)	I'm sure there are doctors that use the new communication tools. Does yours?Making web archives safe	This is an important &amp;lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/509411/computer-scientists-measure-how-much-of-the-web-is-archived/">subject&amp;lt;/a>.	I just moved &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com&amp;lt;/a>, a site that goes back to 1995, from an Apache server to an &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/january/movingScriptingcomToS3">S3 bucket&amp;lt;/a>. In the process we generated a zip file that contains everything. It seems to me that archive is a piece of history. 	What university is ready to receive such a gift?	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/03/arnoSchmidt.gif" width="65" height="89" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named arnoSchmidt.jpg">Background: I have a famous &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt">great uncle&amp;lt;/a> from Germany who was an author and translator. His work is studied in universities. My mother ended up with (paper) copies of all his books from his own collection. We went on a &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/15/uncleArnosBooks.html">search&amp;lt;/a> for a university that would add them to their collection, and &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/12/11/uncleArnosBooksFoundAHome.html">found&amp;lt;/a> one, and now we're fairly confident we did the right thing for Uncle Arno's legacy.	But with digital stuff, who is going to make a big deal out of receiving a zip archive, when anyone's copy is exactly the same as all the others?	In other words, how can I make this bit of history safe? I have no clue.What to do with archives?	My mother's uncle, Arno Schmidt, was a published author in Germany. It's a long story how she ended up with a small collection of his books, but a couple of years ago she decided she wanted to donate them to a university. I've been interested in archives, so I volunteered to help. 	I wrote a blog post, got some interest, and in the end we donated the books to Portland State University. They had a scholar there who studied my uncle, so we felt we did a good job of finding a home for his writing.Seek the geek	Yesterday, the first day of the new year, I walked through Times Square to see what aftermath of the big party. The square was more or less empty, except for a few bits of random &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8332843435/in/photostream">glitter&amp;lt;/a> blown about by sanitation workers, not much was going on. 		&amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8332860845/in/photostream">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/01/02/seeTheGeek.jpg" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" width="640" height="480" border="0" alt="A picture named seeTheGeek.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>	So I had a chance to look more carefully at the incredible array of light shows in the square. One of them apparently had some image detection software, it tuned into me, and put my picture on the billboard for all to see. In a variety of ways! Wow. 	We're getting pretty close to &amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITjsb22-EwQ">Minority Report&amp;lt;/a> stuff. I shot a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8332860845/in/photostream">picture&amp;lt;/a> and showed it to some friends. Everyone found it confusing. Who took the picture, they wanted to know. Me, of course. See if you can figure it out. Then watch the &amp;lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/32114343">video&amp;lt;/a> on Vimeo that explains.Moving scripting.com to S3	With the new &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/amazonAndStaticSites">static sites feature&amp;lt;/a> in Amazon S3, it should now be possible to host scripting.com in an S3 bucket.	This is my first project of the new year. We hope. Knock wood. :-)	I have a script that will upload all the files from scripting.com, some dating back to 1994, to the bucket. 	I would like to, if possible, preserve the creation and mod dates on the files. Through all the transitions over all the years, I have managed to do that because my scripts have been careful to transfer this metadata along with the actual data.	Now I'm trying to figure out if this is possible with S3. I see how you can associate metadata with a file as you upload it. However I don't see a way to transfer the modification and creation dates. If anyone has a clue, the help would be much appreciated. 	PS: I know &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com&amp;lt;/a> is down for most people now.

Now we've got quite a few people running servers, and posting links that are fairly visible. It's better if the name corresponds to the product they're using. Radio2 and River2 --> r2.ly.	And r2.ly is shorter than blork.ly. 	So goodbye my friend Blork -- for now! :-)Apple OS updates scare me	All I want from an operating system is stability and performance. I want it to stay out of my way. I use today's Mac OS largely the same way I used previous versions and how I use Windows. Not looking for innovation in the OS. Pretty sure I'm like most users in this regard. Yet the tech industry seems to think that users want change in the OS. 	I used to get the new versions of the Mac OS whenever they came out, hoping they might have come up with something that I want, until they started changing the way things work. If they weren't adding features, stability or performance, why would I go out of my way or pay money to have them take things out?	To me it doesn't matter if no one else uses a feature I depend on. When they take it out, I either have to do without or find some other way to do it. I don't find it interesting, amusing, entertaining, worthwhile or productive to install new software in order to take steps backwards. Doesn't make any sense that I would. 	The only times I get a new version of the Mac OS is when I have to. I didn't like Lion, but I did want the new MacBook Air that it came on. I would probably buy a new MacBook Air in a few months, if they came out with something enticing, but only if I were sure that it would do all the things my current MacBook Air does. Thing is, with the way they've been doing "upgrades" that's the one thing I'm sure will &amp;lt;i>not&amp;lt;/i> happen. I will take major steps backwards if I install a new verson of Apple's operating system. So rather than buy something new, I'll just stick with what I have. 	I've been here before with Apple. They kept delaying in the transition to System 6. Year after year, it didn't ship. It got bigger and more confusing. At one point Apple told developers not to ship anything until System 6 came out. Then a year went by. And another. People got out of the habit of installing new versions of the OS. And developers got out of the habit of shipping new apps.	Apple is playing an unnecessarilly dangerous game here. They have to deal with the same thing that Microsoft does, that there really aren't any new features people want from OSes. The best OS is one that fades into the background so you can forget it's even there. That can't happen as long as they're deliberately breaking users. 	I went from someone who had a habit of buying something new from Apple every few months, to someone who forgot how to do that because they became tedious and definitely not fun.Olympics on tape-delay? No please!	Is there a way around the tape-delay of NBC's Olympics coverage?

I think it's the same reason I hated &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network">The Social Network&amp;lt;/a>. Because he got it all wrong about how tech companies work. You can't make software and drink like a fool. Maybe you can be a musician that way, but software isn't like that. I don't think basketball players can be heavy drinkers the night before a game. I've never known a great programmer who was also a boozer. 	Anyway that wouldn't have mattered if Sorkin had written an idealistic story for The Social Network like the one he writes for The Newsroom. If he had them arguing about protecting the freedom or privacy of users. Or fighting the corruption of big tech companies, or telling VCs where to shove it, refusing to treat users like hamsters. 	But Sorkin doesn't use the Internet so he doesn't have any great vision for how it could be better. That's where The Newsroom is different. He &amp;lt;i>is&amp;lt;/i> a news user, and he's pissed off at the &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/07/17/theySpreadLies.gif">simple easy things&amp;lt;/a> news people could do to fight for their users. He understands news, not from the inside but from the outside. And that's why the show works. Why it inspires and why it resonates with news users. I'm rooting for Yahoo	Hiring Marissa Mayer is a good thing, imho -- because we all have a lot invested in Yahoo.

However, that might not be Mayer's plan. Berkman river?	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;no-icons>true&amp;lt;/no-icons>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	I came across something I wrote on my Harvard blog in 2003, and there in the right &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/07/10/rightMargin.gif">margin&amp;lt;/a> was a link to a Berkman aggregator that is long-gone. 	Later I wondered what that river might look like now, if we had a good collection of Berkman blogs.

I thought when I clicked on it I'd find that one of our earlier presidents had an African-American grandfather or grandmother. Maybe Chester Alan Arthur? Or Woodrow Wilson? Richard Nixon! Heh. Funny. Anyway, it was flipped around. Freeman was saying that because Obama had a white mother and a black father, he's mixed-race, not black. Interesting. How black do you have to be for Morgan Freeman to consider you black? Seems there are fewer "pure" people in the US all the time. Maybe at some point we will feel it was strange that we  bothered to make a distinction. Would that be a good thing?&lt;/pre>June 2012 = &lt;pre>Our Supreme Court	I almost put a question mark at the end of that. Because so many people were so sure that it wasn't ours, rather it belonged to the part of the American political system that had lost its mind. 	After reading a few thousand words in the last 24 hours on the decision, and the history of such decisions, it's clear that the Chief Justice of the United States is thinking long-term, as I thought he would be. Or hoped he would. 	Whether the place he wants to lead us is where I would like to go is another matter. But at least he's got a sense of time that's got some maturity to it, a sense of history, and an appreciation for the responsibility that has been given to him. 	So maybe it is *our* court. It was supposed to be our government, but so many people don't see it that way. I'm stubborn, because I still do.	BTW, the cable news coverage last night on CNN on Piers Morgan was really good. Maybe it's just that they need a meaty story that's actually new to create a news program that activates the mind?Bi-partisan	I've read a few thousand words today about the Supreme Court decision, but haven't heard anyone observe that it was bipartisan. That's why it's so powerful. We have two branches of government led by people who take their jobs and legacy seriously. That's a place to start. Maybe this will embolden the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to take more risks (he's also a Republican).Quick review: Chrome on iPad	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/06/28/pitcher.gif" width="125" height="143" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named pitcher.gif">I'm a Chrome user on Mac and Windows, so of course I wanted to try it on the iPad, and I liked it immediately. 	But I don't think I can switch from Safari. One reason is the toolbar bookmarks don't work the same way they work in the desktop versions of Chrome and in Safari on the iPad. It's three steps to click on a bookmark, and in Safari it's just one. That's a huge difference, where there are a set of pages I visit regularly. 	Also Twitter for some reason gives me a mobile interface on Chrome and on Safari gives me the normal interface. Why sites keep treating iPads differently from desktops is a mystery to me. It's got a full-size screen. Don't be so fancy, "different" is not better. 	However, I'd &amp;lt;i>like&amp;lt;/i> to be able to switch to Chrome to have everything all synched up across all my platforms. Maybe they can address the bookmarks question in an update, or maybe I'm missing something??NPR and Twitter	How I'm following the SCOTUS decision: I'm watching Twitter and listening to WNYC-FM.

I realized I was putting too much effort into functionality that wasn't that important. Happens often with easily-distracted geekoids. :-)&amp;lt;/i>	I'm trying to do something fancy with Disqus. Possibly too fancy. But the idea is very compelling. So I'm struggling to make it work. 	Here's the situation:		I have a page with many items on it.		Each item has a discussion icon floating on the right margin.		When you mouseover the icon, three globals are set, including myId and myUrl. 		A Bootstrap 2 modal dialog pops up and in its bind callback we call DISQUS.reset, with this.page.identifier and this.page.url set from myId and myUrl.		It works in a &amp;lt;a href="http://disqusdemo.blorkmark.com/">simple case&amp;lt;/a> with two threads.		It works in a &amp;lt;a href="http://1974.mediahackers.org/myStreamOfConscienceForJune12012">more complex case&amp;lt;/a> with a bunch.		But now it fails to load unique threads on the new pages I start. Here's an &amp;lt;a href="http://1974.mediahackers.org/greatMusic">example&amp;lt;/a>. It's just re-using the threads over and over. I'm fairly sure the IDs I'm sending are unique. I constructed the URLs without any idea to what they're supposed to do. The IDs seem like they should be enough. I don't want or need pages that display a discussion thread all on its own. 		&amp;lt;a href="http://docs.disqus.com/help/85/">The help page&amp;lt;/a> doesn't say very much. It says that you have to have a hash-bang url. I tried that, and it didn't appear to make a difference. As I said, I don't understand what role the URL is playing here.	It's probably something I broke (I hope!) but I'm pulling out what's left of my hair trying to figure this out.	Be a Javascript hero today, and help me figure this out.

You could write a blog post in print on the op-ed page of the Times. But as soon as another person is involved in the writing of the piece, we're not talking about a blog anymore. 	The process continued over the years. 	In &amp;lt;a href="http://rebootnews.wordpress.com/">podcasts&amp;lt;/a> with Jay Rosen, we talked about this a lot. Jay is a well-known journalism professor at NYU. I of course, am a blogger. 	In that period I came up with this idea. Bloggers are what journalists call &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/03/19/theRebootOfJournalism.html">sources&amp;lt;/a>. Originators of information or ideas. People who make news, and not people who report news.  	I think that distinction is very important when trying to decide who has the official shield of a journalist, protected from government prosecution when leaks are involved. As long as the person is reporting the news, and not making the news, then we're clearly talking about a journalist and not a blogger. 	If this is what a journalist is, then Glenn Greenwald was most definitely a journalist when reporting the Snowden story, as long as all he did was report on the leaks. If he himself leaked, then he is a blogger. 	Hope this helps.Write a blog post with Fargo	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;font-family>Georgia&amp;lt;/font-family>			&amp;lt;font-size>18px&amp;lt;/font-size>			&amp;lt;line-height>150%&amp;lt;/line-height>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	The howtos keep coming!	&amp;lt;a href="http://dave.smallpict.com/2013/06/29/howToWriteABlogPostWithFargo">http://dave.smallpict.com/2013/06/29/howToWriteABlogPostWithFargo&amp;lt;/a>	This one shows you how to write a blog post with our new outliner, Fargo.	Still lots more docs to write, but the product is feeling pretty good. :-)I fucked up	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;font-family>Georgia&amp;lt;/font-family>			&amp;lt;font-size>18px&amp;lt;/font-size>			&amp;lt;line-height>150%&amp;lt;/line-height>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	Why are these three words so hard to say?	&amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html">Programmers&amp;lt;/a>, when they fix a bug, are implicitly saying exactly that.	And the process of building a piece of software involves the constant fixing of bugs.	When I write a piece of code, I write it knowing it has bugs. The first time I use it, I notice things I didn't see when I was visualizing the software before it existed. The process involves lots of &amp;lt;i>I fucked up&amp;lt;/i> admissions.	I remember the first time I read the log of a professional tester who was evaluating software I had written. I was shocked, hurt, enraged, disappointed, troubled, felt inadequate, all these emotions -- but after I calmed down, I fixed as many of the problems as I could. Later, when I had my own company I hired people to write these reports for my programmers. Everyone has to face the reality of what their software looks like to people who use it, who don't know how to avoid all the traps. And some people do this so well they can do it for a living.	When I was young there were a lot of foods I didn't like. Cheese, fish, tomatoes, olives, to name a few. When I was 18, I made a conscious decision to try to eat all these things, and find out if it was still true. Turns out there were some things I still didn't like, but others were just the tastebuds of a child rejecting complex or subtle flavors or smells. 	I tried the same thing, later, with apologizing and admitting mistakes. Like a lot of people, I didn't like to admit mistakes. I think this was the way I was brought up. In my family, if you admitted a mistake, or even changed your mind, this was used to invalidate your ideas, for years to come.&amp;lt;i> I remember once you said something wrong,&amp;lt;/i> would be the response to a complaint. The implication is if you were wrong once, you're wrong now. So I learned not to admit it. 	That was a mistake. I fucked up. I'm sorry. 	Try it some time. See what happens. I bet with most people they will respect you more for it. I know I will. 	No harm in making a mistake. We all do it. Weddings in the news	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;font-family>Georgia&amp;lt;/font-family>			&amp;lt;font-size>18px&amp;lt;/font-size>			&amp;lt;line-height>150%&amp;lt;/line-height>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/06/29/arrows.gif" width="145" height="131" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named arrows.gif">Being rich only makes you rich. It doesn't make you beautiful, smart, nice to be around, happy, young, healthy, wise etc.	Being rich means, for a lot of people, that they buy lots of things that require other people to keep going. Companies, houses, cars, boats, planes, huge weddings. That means you spend a lot of time dealing with employees. And they are no substitute for friends. And sometimes rich people get the idea that their friends should be more like employees. That narrows the circle even more. 	Becoming rich can be a disaster, especially if they are not yet fully developed as a person. They have the wrong idea of what being rich means to others. They're surprised and angered by the response they get from people who would like to be rich, but feel like it will never happen for them. Being on the receiving end of &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">schadenfreude&amp;lt;/a> is tough, esp when you were expecting adulation. 	So Sean Parker's wedding was a huge schadenfreude magnet. People who had been reading stories of Silicon Valley billionaires finally had something to attach their anger to. Parker stood up with a big target on his back and wonders where all the arrows came from.	Once when I had a company in nice office on &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=117+Easy+St%2C+Mountain+View%2C+CA+94043&amp;data=!1m4!1m3!1d4540!2d-122.0677594!3d37.3926972!4m11!1m10!4m8!1m3!1d48363!2d-73.9892755!3d40.7472454!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!17b1">Easy Street&amp;lt;/a> in Mountain View, I found out that a guy I knew, who had made a lot of money from some patents, lived in a modest middle-class house down the street. It was a very ordinary house. I asked him why not live in a mansion. And he told me something that stuck with me all these years. He liked living an ordinary life. I remembered his story, but I ended up having to learn it for myself.	A few years later I got hit by the Silicon Valley money truck. I had a big bank account, house, long driveway in the best neighborhood, and was young and beautiful, had everything one could possibly hope for, in terms of possessions, the things money can buy. And then the bottom dropped out of my life out at exactly the moment you would have thought I had it made. I realized I had believed in something that was wrong. That wealth would lead to a feeling of happiness and security. Almost exactly the opposite was true. 	As long as I was poor, I had something to struggle for. A reason to justify my unhappiness. Once the struggle was over, how could you explain the empty small feeling inside? That was all that was left after the struggle. 	The truth is that no matter how much you have, you still occupy the same amount of space and time. You can buy big things, but they are not you. That's the other side of the sadness of Parker's wedding. &amp;lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/27/weddings-used-to-be-sacred-and-other-lessons-about-internet-journalism/">His anger&amp;lt;/a> isn't really with the Internet or journalists. He's projecting. His anger is with existence. Look, I got all this material stuff, and they don't love me. They aren't impressed. Which is just a trick your mind plays. What the anger really means is that there is no love in here, inside me. My soul is not impressed. All this crazyness isn't me. Help, I'm lost. Where am I?	My friend with his small house on Easy Street had the right answer. Money is nice, but if you let it be everything, you are nothing.	Me, years later, I still need to learn this lesson. I hope to reach a nirvana where everything will fall into place and happiness and security will result. Inside I know this is not true. But my heart very much still wants it to be true. I don't think it ever really gets easier. :-)	PS: There are other &amp;lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/samesexmarriage/ci_23542472/gay-marriage-prop-8-supreme-court-ruling">weddings&amp;lt;/a> in the news.

It's written in Javascript and runs on Linux. Gradually we're smoothing out all the components, and will introduce them one by one to writers and designers who use the Fargo outliner. 	This is the system I've been dreaming of, and finally it's coming into view. 	I couldn't have done it without the incredible JavaScript, CSS and server depth of my young programming partner, &amp;lt;a href="http://www.kyleshank.com/">Kyle Shank&amp;lt;/a>. He started programming in the mid-90s, and the first bit of code he conquered was in a website. After that he got a computer engineering degree, so he knows the techniques you need to create serious stuff. 	It's very true that there are advantages to being young and starting fresh. I learned the web too, but at the time, I already had a couple of careers under my belt. 	On the other hand, there are also advantages to having experience. The great movie &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday">Any Given Sunday&amp;lt;/a> is a perfect theme for how programmers work together, as it tells the story of the struggles of a coach and a young quarterback to win the Superbowl. Excellent acting and storytelling by Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx and Oliver Stone. If you haven't seen it, go. It'll open your eyes. I recommend it to all the programmers I work with.	PS: If you want to hook into my new feed, it's here: &amp;lt;a href="http://dave.smallpict.com/rss.xml">http://dave.smallpict.com/rss.xml&amp;lt;/a>.

I didn't dream it, it actually happened. I just listened as he ranted about how idiotic the people at Apple were. This was just after he took over, he was cleaning house. I never figured out why he called me, I didn't ask (it would be impolite) and besides, I was too star-struck to think to ask. 	It happened again, almost ten years later, outside a restaurant in San Francisco. I was with &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Scoble">Scoble&amp;lt;/a> and &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Hachamovitch">Dean Hachamovitch&amp;lt;/a>. Scoble worked at Microsoft then, and Dean was in charge of Microsoft's browser. Jobs was ranting, again he was the only one talking,  saying how Microsoft was going to steal all the good ideas in Safari, he just knew it, and he didn't mind, because he's an artist and they're something else that's not an artist. I thought it was funny because the ideas he was so proud of were themselves stolen, and memorable because I got to watch the reality distortion of Steve Jobs up close and personal. Once again, uncharacteristically, I didn't say a word. 	It must have been tough being a programmer working for Steve Jobs. He projected a distorted reality, but programmers have to exist in plain old reality. You can't lie to a compiler. Or you can, but the code won't work until you take the lies out. Garbage in, garbage out. Programs internally are rigid and inflexible and are not subject to Jobsian persuasiveness. 	Anyway, there are two sides to &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">reality distortion&amp;lt;/a> -- on one side is the purveyor and on the other are the people who are effected it. There are many RDF's out there, not just the one around Apple and its products. Android has a reality distortion field. At one point open source software had one, but it's not so strong anymore. Same with Windows and MS-DOS. Old school journalism is a total RDF, where the belief is that reporting has to be done the way it was in the 20th century or else everything will crumble. People like &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Simon">David Simon&amp;lt;/a> and &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Bergman">Lowell Bergman&amp;lt;/a> are major purveyors of this style of &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">RDF&amp;lt;/a>. 	Having been a developer for many years, and having spent quite a few of them around Apple, I've had to deal with RDFs almost constantly. Only the other day did I realize something very important about them, that I wanted to share. 	1. The people in distorted reality believe it. They don't know they're in a RDF.	2. When you you say something that conflicts with their RDF they feel threatened.	3. You can calm them down by saying very clearly, that your desire for something other than what they think is the only true way will not in any way effect their ability to continue to exist in their version of reality. 	I learned this because people who believe in mailbox-style RSS readers are in a RDF. If I say "I like a river style of news" they almost explode in passion and sometimes rage. They tell you what they need. At length, in great detail. I never understood why they do this. But I have found the solution. Just say "Hey I can have a river and you can have a mailbox and the earth will still revolve around the sun, birds will sing in the morning, people will fall in love and have babies, etc etc." My getting what I want won't effect you getting what you want. That does seem to settle it, in most cases. 	One more thing. When Jobs died the power source for Apple's RDF went with him. The last keynote, which was broadcast so I got to watch it, was a constant reminder of that Steve is gone.	The demo of the car-racing kids from Carnegie-Mellon at the beginning was the first clue. Yes, some of the execs have been taking Steve lessons. But none of them have the chutzpah, the self-confidence, the swagger, the ability to &amp;lt;a href="http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2010-09-23/">induce&amp;lt;/a> a drug-like euphoria. Having never experienced that myself (I never liked the Steve way of selling, I thought it was smarmy, I mostly wanted to slap him for being such a dork) I can only theorize. 	Even so, I used to love buying new Apple stuff. I so totally wanted to buy something after watching the keynote. I even tried, subconsciously of course, pouring a bottle of water on my MacBook Air, but it booted back up a couple of days later. 	They have nothing I want or need. I hope they get it together again, I'm still a shareholder, but I fear that was it. The man behind the curtain is dead, and we now go back to normal reality. Have to find someone else to excite us. What would news do?	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;font-family>Georgia&amp;lt;/font-family>			&amp;lt;font-size>18px&amp;lt;/font-size>			&amp;lt;line-height>150%&amp;lt;/line-height>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/06/26/ouija.gif" width="145" height="96" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named ouija.gif">&amp;lt;/a>Got an email yesterday from a reporter at BusinessWeek, wanting to know, if Google couldn't make RSS work, why are so many others interested. I decided to talk to the reporter, on the record, despite my &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/06/22/whyIDontDoInterviews.html">rule&amp;lt;/a> of not doing interviews. 		Truth be told I have been breaking the rule since launching &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a>, not often, but as a practical matter, the founder of a startup can't afford to be too shy when it comes to press. Things are different now, I now have a reason to talk to reporters, and hope for a decent quote.		Turns out I didn't get quoted in the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-26/if-google-cant-make-its-rss-reader-work-why-are-others-so-interested#r=nav-r-story">piece&amp;lt;/a>. So I'll write a blog post about it instead. 	The answer is simple. RSS is the way news is distributed on the Internet. That's why so many people want to be #1 in this area. News is big business. And starting in the mid-90s news has been on the Internet, and it's not going away just because Google is getting out.	I think Google made a huge mistake with RSS, and that's why the others are rushing in to try to be the new king of news on the net. Their excuse, imho, is as silly as it would be if they cancelled GMail because people are texting more. Google killed Reader because they're a big &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija">ouija board&amp;lt;/a> with internal politics, just like every other big company. They made a mistake. The mistake was getting into RSS in the first place, when they didn't have a love of news. They were rudderless. No sense of direction. The fairest thing they could do with RSS is what they did, get out. I often wonder why people take jobs as CEOs of companies that make things they have no passion for. Same idea. Google did not love RSS. So they shouldn't have tried to own it. Once that dawned on them, the only rational answer was to transition out.	In the coming competition the winner, imho, will be the ones who love news with all their heart, and have a clear intuitive way to answer this question when they have to -- &amp;lt;i>What would news do? &amp;lt;/i>	A better question (which I asked the reporter): Why isn't Bloomberg launching a net-based news-for-everyone service to fill the void left by Google?Say no to synching and RSS	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;font-family>Georgia&amp;lt;/font-family>			&amp;lt;font-size>18px&amp;lt;/font-size>			&amp;lt;line-height>150%&amp;lt;/line-height>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/06/25/loveRss.gif" width="150" height="150" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named loveRss.gif">Jamie Zawinski wrote a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/06/google-reader-apocalypse-extremely-fucking-nigh/">fantastic rant&amp;lt;/a> about the demise of Google Reader. Go read it now and love the way he writes. But let's not jump so fast back into the synching mess that we got into in the Google Reader era of RSS. 	We could be entering an era of low barriers to entry, competition, new ideas, innovation, and freedom from big tech companies. Things could get a lot better, right now, and keep getting better. Or, as Zawinski says, it could just be a more miserable version of what we're leaving behind. 	To get better, we just have to give up on the idea of synching. That a special piece of software has to be written for every device you own, and that each of those apps needs to know what articles you've clicked on. That was the weakness in the old way of doing things. It made it ridiculously expensive to run an aggregator. It made it so that small companies or individuals couldn't experiment with a very simple technology. Why the largest of the tech companies came to dominate even though its heart wasn't in it. Because it took huge resources to run the central node in that network.	These days we can create beautiful software running in the web browser. It might not be 100 percent as elegant as what you get from an iOS app, but it comes without Apple's censorship and with no need to synch. If you use the same app everywhere, it can just store the information once in the same place it stores your subscriptions, and you're almost perfectly happy and RSS gets a chance to thrive. 	It's still super expensive to run an aggregator, but we can make it easier, as users, by giving up this one thing.	Let's love the browser again, as we once did, and RSS can flourish again.As July 1 approaches	Evan Hansen at Medium asked if I would write a &amp;lt;a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/2bc7f6223602">piece&amp;lt;/a> for them for the July 1 turn-over of the RSS market to the people. Who knows what's going to happen? I sure don't. But then I realized I have something to say at this juncture.	The last few years, as Google has come to dominate the RSS market, have been very bad for RSS, imho. I say that because a technology with tremendous potential for decentralizing news flow became one of the Internet's most singularly centralized technologies. We couldn't move in RSS-land because any change had to be implemented by Google. And their only ideas seemed to be how to most efficiently kill RSS, not to improve it, make it work better. As their involvement neared the end, all you would hear from the tech press were gloating cheers that RSS had died. Twitter was the new RSS. Never did they say how actively the other big tech companies had conspired to kill it. 	If RSS had been a product, the advent of Twitter would have been its moment of greatest glory. Because it would have forced Twitter to remain open to competition. Twitter's business model might have been simplifying and rationalizing RSS, which RSS certainly needed, and they would have been entitled to get hugely rich for pulling that off. 	Had RSS been a product, subscription would have become easy, not an increasingly complex maze of negative feedback, thanks to deliberate sidetracks from the leading browser vendors. If you doubt this, try clicking on &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">this link&amp;lt;/a>, to an RSS feed, and see how hard it is to just view the contents of the file. In Chrome, Safari or Firefox there's no way to do it. In this one area apparently Microsoft wins the prize, and all they had to do is not screw with RSS, and let the browser render it as it would any other file. Whether Google, Apple or Mozilla actively wanted to kill RSS doesn't matter -- the net-effect was the same. How can you use it if you can't even click a link to begin the subscription process.	So now, here we are at a crossroads. There are &amp;lt;i>lots&amp;lt;/i> of ways RSS could improve. The question is this -- will the tech industry learn how to cooperate on an open format, or will each of them play a game of winner-take-all, which will certainly result in none of them getting anything in return for all their efforts. 	My company, &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/">Small Picture&amp;lt;/a>, is working on authoring tools to create new RSS feeds. I have a private on-the-side project, just me personally, to help foster the development of new river-of-news aggregators, commercial and open source. 	I would love to see RSS achieve some of its great potential. There are still millions of feeds being actively updated every day. This is a treasure that we can build on, instead of watching the tech industry fight to kill it, once again.	Not sure whether I should be optimistic. But if the tech industry can turn this corner, then there's nothing we can't do. But having spent 40-plus years in this industry, I don't have much cause for optimism. RSS Viewer app	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;font-family>Georgia&amp;lt;/font-family>			&amp;lt;font-size>18px&amp;lt;/font-size>			&amp;lt;line-height>150%&amp;lt;/line-height>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	I got tired of fighting with Chrome and Safari over whether I'm allowed to read RSS files.	&amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/rssViewer.html">http://smallpicture.com/rssViewer.html&amp;lt;/a>	Just enter the URL in the dialog and click OK.	It even remembers the URL you can read the same file over and over.	Nice if you're trying to watch the file change.	PS: Drag it to the browser's chrome for easy access.	PPS: I look forward to the day when the big guys stop screwing with RSS.

Being so public with their &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/magazine/30Wikileaks-t.html?pagewanted=all">personal dislike&amp;lt;/a> of Julian Assange raised questions about how the Times was managing the story. 	It also raised doubts about their integrity, imho. Why be so vocal about Assange? Has there never before been a newsmaker that they didn't like personally, is that why this is news? Or is it possible they wanted to draw a distinction between what they do and what he does for selfish reasons, like staying out of jail? They could see clearly that Assange was in legal trouble, and might have been trying to avoid that for themselves, by joining the demeaning (for all of us) personal smear campaign against him.	No matter what, it was insulting to readers of the Times to assume we care what the top editorial guy at the Times thought of Assange personally. If he wants to vent his feelings, he should have quit his job and written a blog. The Times itself has no business having an opinion about someone's socks, unless somehow they are presenting themselves as an authority on socks, which as far as I know Assange never has. 	PS: This was going to be a longer post, but I just heard about Snowden's &amp;lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/17/edward-snowden-nsa-files-whistleblower">live video Q&amp;A&amp;lt;/a> at 11AM today (a little less than 2 hours). I have to get my other work done before that.

As we lose control, they gain it. 	In this war, the governments have more in common than they have differences. The Chinese probably could destroy our banking system, and we could probably destroy theirs, but they don't want that, and our government doesn't either. They're really on the same side.	What they want is to keep order, I really believe that. The order that keeps the rich rich, and more or less ignores the challenges we all face in keeping our species alive on this planet. I understand the sentiment. There's so much to comprehend, if you want to have any kind of quality of life, you have to compartmentalize. If you look at preserving order, you can't pay attention to climate change.	I think though we all know the precarious system of banking and computer networks isn't going to keep running forever. There's going to be a meltdown. We had one in 2008, and it looks like we just re-inflated the bubble temporarily, bought a little time, it's just going to get us back to where we were, only this time the pop will be bigger. 	If you were President of the United States, and you saw a certain probability of this happening, you'd re-up on the side of preserving order. That means you have to be prepared for the day when people go to the ATM and find their bank account is inaccessible. When it happens to everyone even. How are the rich people going to enjoy their lifestyles when that kind of chaos is going on? It seems quite possible we'll live to see this happen. 	It's all tech, top to bottom. The banking system is tech. The military is tech. And in that context, it's not surprising that our, the people's, information access systems are really weak compared to the ones the governments have. That's no accident. Our tools have been getting more precarious, thanks to bugs introduced by the browser vendors (if they're not deliberate, they're incredibly incompetent, your choice). And Google captured almost all the tech of RSS, only to shut it down. Just as things show some sign of coming back to life, now Facebook sounds like they'd like to have their turn at pwning the open public news flow. Please, if you make a feed, and you read this, keep making the feed as-is, no matter what Facebook asks you to do to it. By now it should be obvious that the big tech companies are not our friends. They're more like the government than they are like you and me. Maybe not their fault, maybe they didn't see it coming, but I doubt they'd deny that they're there now. 	JavaScript is another item that we should be thinking about. Google is developing the same kind of power over the programming language of the Internet that they had over RSS. Over time they're likely to move their implementation of JS away from the standard. I've spent most of the last year programming in JS, and I think there's a lot to be &amp;lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57584979-93/google-dart-will-rescue-browsers-from-javascript/">said&amp;lt;/a> for making the language smaller and more efficient. But I'm a newbie, and if I had spent the last five years developing in it, the last thing I'd want to hear is that the language itself is considered a moving target. So, net-net, we have to insist that for now at least JS stay what it is. I don't trust anything about Google to do this right. They may think they know what they're doing, but they led us right into control by the government. That's a mess that needs undoing, and they shouldn't be creating any more messes. 	One more note. I said a while back that if you want to understand politics you have to become deeply immersed in tech. The political reporters and bloggers have been totally too casual about that, even the smart relatively open-minded ones, and that even includes Glenn Greenwald. Is he really prepared to listen to Snowden, or can he just report an approximation of what Snowden tells him? It's the latter, because as smart as Greenwald is, he hasn't been spending the last N years schooling himself in the technology that we've built our existence around. 	So think about it, how are we going to boot up the intelligence we need to make sense of this situation in time to make a difference?	Serious question, and heavy times. There's more than one tech	We tend to use the word &amp;lt;i>tech&amp;lt;/i> as if there was only one tech, but there's more than one. 	1. These days when people say tech they usually mean the money. So the VCs are the &amp;lt;a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/06/13/what-fred-wilson-the-godfather-of-new-york-tech-learned-from-the-dotcom-bubble/">godfathers&amp;lt;/a> of tech. The gatekeepers. The bloggers. When so many tech bloggers become VCs that tells you something. 	2. But tech also means the product. I'm a developer. I want to know which products are interesting from a feature standpoint. I look at tech the way a movie guy looks at movies. I want new ideas. And I want my peers to study the new things I come up with. We actually used to do this at one point, sort of. Reviewing products never got that great. Nowadays what passes for tech commentary amounts to whether your icons are flat or &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeumorphic&amp;lt;/a>. Honestly, there's a lot more to it than that. #understatement	3. And there's hippie tech, where tech is about freedom of expression and connecting people with others. Not as a business model but as people. Where the value of a person isn't how much you can get an advertiser to pay to reach them, but in the intrinsic value of a person with a mind, a heart, spririt, relationships with other people, a lifespan, a philosophy, feelings, ideas. I'm a hippie tech guy too. I really believe in the power of the technology to connect people. I think we're worth it. Maybe I'm foolish. It wouldn't surprise me. ;-)		Most of the great mottos come from hippie tech.		I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years, it's even worse than it appears!		And don't even get me started on Big Lebowski. ;-)	4. There's spy tech, as we learned about last week from Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald. Those guys, all of them, not just the whistleblowers, are a lot like us. They &amp;lt;i>are&amp;lt;/i> us, in different circumstances. Most of my classmates graduating with Computer Science degrees in 1978 went to work for the government or quasi-government companies. My education was paid for mostly by the military. These were people I loved to talk geek with. I even know some of them because you cross paths with them in the entrepreneurial tech scene of #1, #2 and #3. (BTW, I have been part of the system of #1, long ago, before it became so concentrated on users as eyeballs and couch potatoes.) I sold software to spy tech in the 80s. Outliners and presentation software. They loved the stuff. Really.	I wouldn't mind investing in new tech, but almost everyone seems to think it's about tricking people to give something up you can sell to someone who's pretty sleazy. And we've seen where that leads us. Some asshole in government realizes there's all this great spy data in the tech companies, and gets a judge to make them turn it over. So now the VCs are selling us out to the bad guys in government too. You don't have to be much of a student of history to know &amp;lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229">where&amp;lt;/a> this &amp;lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/video/2013/jun/09/data-snooping-law-abiding-citizens-nothing-fear-hague-video">leads&amp;lt;/a>. 	So I'd never want to invest in a technology that views its users as chumps. I want to make stuff that celebrates the intellect and humanity of my users. Otherwise, I'd rather do something peaceful with small impact, like reading books and writing poetry. 	I was talking with a friend the other day, he owns a tech startup, and is fairly wealthy from an earlier success. I said, regarding the mess that's been exposed around the NSA, "If we don't do something, who will?" What I meant is relative to most people we have a lot of freedom, and we also know our way around tech. He asked what would we do. On the way out of the restaurant I said we should create only products that were &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+irrevocable">irrevocably&amp;lt;/a> open. He doubted it was possible. "Oh it's possible," I said.	My new product Fargo is most definitely irrevocably open. I don't have to give the users access to their data. It's sitting in a folder on their hard drive, in a documented XML-based file format. There is proven interop.  So I can't take it back, once the files are out there, the users can leave any time they want. We don't even have copies of the files (although Dropbox does).	No this isn't a solution to all the problems, but it's a start. If a VC wanted to take us somewhere worth going they would insist that all their investments do this. But of course they won't because the only way they make money is by exercising that control. If the users of Tumblr had a say whether Yahoo would be hosting their blogs, well, they wouldn't have gotten so much money for it. It's the lock-in that creates the value. For the product designer in me (#2) this is kind of a no-op, but for the hippie it's No Sale Buddy. I could never take their money, and they would never offer it, as long as I had to deal with users &amp;lt;a href="http://www.iclarified.com/31133/how-much-is-an-apple-user-worth-chart">this way&amp;lt;/a>. Because it would depend on my users being dumb, and as I said earlier, my users are anything but. They're the smartest people on the planet and I want to keep it that way. And I think anyone who makes software for dumb people in the end gets what they deserve. :-)For people who follow me on Twitter	&amp;lt;a href="http://docs.reallysimple.org/">Radio2&amp;lt;/a>, the app that connects my linkblog feed to Twitter uses an old version of the Twitter API. They've been saying for a long time that this version would eventually be turned off, and yesterday seems to be the day that happened. This means that links from my feed will not appear on Twitter. I can't say when or if the app will be updated to work with the new API. I'm busy working on &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">stuff&amp;lt;/a> for Small Picture, and Radio2 is no longer a priority for me. Sorry.	However, the &amp;lt;a href="http://links.scripting.com/rss.xml">feed is RSS&amp;lt;/a>, so it's possible to get the links through some other mechanism. I'm going to keep pushing links to the feed. It's a habit that's hard to break. I use it for bookmarking things I want to &amp;lt;a href="http://links.scripting.com/">come back to&amp;lt;/a>. That's not something I plan to stop doing, anytime. And sharing the links is fun for me. I know I'm weird. ;-)	Caveat: It's a funny form of RSS because the items don't have titles. Google didn't like this kind of feed, but then it's almost gone, so that might not even be a problem. I've always felt this feed would be a good match for app.net or tent.io, and it would be great if the newly invigorated feed readers like Feedly would try to make sense of this kind of feed. It's perfectly valid RSS 2.0. Now that I'm losing my Twitter readers, it would be nice to make it up in some other way. 	Things seem to be changing quite rapidly nowadays what with the NSA, and Google Reader going away, and Twitter shutting off their old API. Apple radically changing the UX of iOS, etc. It's almost as if there's this incredible disconnect between users and the government and the big tech companies. 	I'm just going to keep programming, writing and linking and hope for the best! :-)	Knock wood, praise Murphy, IANAL, MMLM, etc.Something amiss in IOS-Land?	Two blog posts in the last 24 hours add up to something possibly amiss?	1. Linus Ekenstam's &amp;lt;a href="https://medium.com/trends-predictions/c22abbd34df0">Simplicity my ass&amp;lt;/a>. It's a wonderful rant, and I say that with deepest respect as someone who believes the rant is rapidly becoming a lost art. We need more strong opinion. Too many people wishing and washing. Say what you think. And what Mr Ekenstam thinks is that IOS 7 is a crock. 	2. In his own way, &amp;lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/06/11/fertile-ground">Marco Arment agrees&amp;lt;/a> that IOS 7 is a crock, but one filled with opportunity for predatory developers, such as Marco. Of course he just sold Instapaper to Betaworks, and his Tumblr stock, sold to Yahoo, has made him rich -- so he has nothing to lose as Apple, apparently has pulled the rug out from all their developers. This is also a great rant, filled with testosterone. A &amp;lt;i>must-read&amp;lt;/i> in what is becoming a lost art. 	So, if all this is true, what does it mean?	I can't imagine that developers relish the choices that Apple is giving them.	But what about users? As an iPod user myself, I'm accustomed to Apple ripping up the pavement in iTunes, making things that I depend on disappear in one version, only to re-appear years later in a wholly new place in the UI. Most of my use of the iPod depends on this connection, so I've deliberately kept my dependency on this product limited. I'm accustomed to Apple playing hide-and-seek with vital features.	My iPads are a somewhat different story. I use lots of software there. Some of it might go away. It's hard to imagine me getting too upset. Until I read these two pieces. 	As a veteran developer myself, I'm so glad I do not develop for this platform. 	I am still an Apple shareholder. Not necessarily happy about that! :-(	And as someone who relishes tech as entertainment, I'm grabbing a box of virtual popcorn and watching, hopefully from a safe-enough distance.I had to get a NYT Digital Subscription to figure out what's wrong	Yesterday I posted a &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/344584704449736705">tweet&amp;lt;/a> with some feedback for the NY Times marketers.	&amp;lt;i>Getting a NYT Digital Subscription should open up something new and wonderful that I can kvell about. #freeadvice&amp;lt;/i>	I sent the link to &amp;lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/faculty/jay-rosen/">Jay Rosen&amp;lt;/a>, my former colleague at NYU, and he said I had to write a blog post about this. Here it is.	After years of hearing about paywalls from the Times, I've mostly been able to read the articles I wanted. I have many avenues into the site. All the links from my river work. When I see a link on Twitter, I can click on it. It's only when I want to go from one of those articles to another that the paywall stops me.	I've long felt I should go ahead and subscribe, but I found the special offer of 99 cents for the first 90 days to be insulting. They make a product that's for smart people. Sheez, it's not as if we're going to cancel after 90 days, and btw we know that it's &amp;lt;i>hard&amp;lt;/i> to cancel these things. When you enter your credit card info and click Submit, you more or less have signed up for life. Right??	I decided to subscribe, finally, because I would like to wander around the site unimpeded by the paywall. I wondered what that would be like.	I read a lot of books and watch movies, and I think of the Times reviewers as authoritative, and their reviews go back many decades. So I'd like to be able to wander around their Arts section. Wandering seems to be the key idea. Here's a site that has a lot of stuff I'm interested in, and it's been many years since I've been able to wander freely through it. I imagined it might be wonderful.	I can tell you, a few days later, my life has not changed. I still use the site the same way I did before I paid. 	I want to kvell about how wonderful it is to have a NYT Digital Subscription, but I don't have any great ideas about how to use this vast resource of information that's now fully open to me. I want to love it more, but I don't know how.	From their point of view -- what a missed opportunity! I have 63K follower on Twitter. If I said "Hey this is great, I never knew what I was missing," that might not make anyone subscribe, but it might get a few to think about it. The wall of resistance has only so many bricks. Every time one is removed you get closer to a sale.	If you're going to have digital subscibers you have to think like digital marketers. Think of the Times as a vast palace of entertaining information for people with active minds. How can you make that more accessible in ways that will make a difference for people with the new ability to freely roam the site. 	Then you'll have something. Why tech responds poorly to crises, and how to do better	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.ou.edu/deptcomm/dodjcc/groups/02C2/Johnson%20&amp;%20Johnson.htm">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/06/09/tylenol.gif" width="109" height="180" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named tylenol.gif">&amp;lt;/a>The first time I saw a tech company blow it in the Internet age was in 1994 when Intel was trying to quell public outrage about a problem with math functions on their Pentium chip. According to &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug">Wikipedia&amp;lt;/a>, an estimated 1 in 9 billion floating point divides would produce inaccurate results. The problem could be demonstrated in Excel. Intel said the flaw was so small that it didn't warrant any concern by users. They were probably right. But that didn't stop the outrage from escalating. Every time Intel spoke, the problem got worse. Eventually they had to offer replacement chips to any user who wanted one. It might have cost much less if they had admitted the problem at the start.	It doesn't happen often that the press sides with users, but when it does, the tech industry usually reacts poorly. The reason is simple. They're accustomed to Gee Whiz treatment from the press. That the people who run the companies are themselves miracles. Because the products they make are so impressive to the people in the press.	But that's going to fade over time, as tech products become more ordinary. Kids who were brought up with the products don't think they're so amazing, and they'll become reporters or bloggers, and the tech industry will have to deal with crisis not by stonewalling, but with empathy, and understanding of how the public thinks.	An exec at Google or Facebook might be puzzled by the reaction to the NSA news. Didn't they already know that we have to provide the government with information when they have a legal basis for requiring it? Maybe people did know. But that doesn't matter. Right now they're not happy about it. And the blame is falling on the tech companies. Usually reporters just rewrite press releases. But every once in a while they express their independence. This is one of those times. 	The classic example of a company responding well to a crisis that's no fault of theirs was Johnson &amp; Johnson with the &amp;lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tylenol_murders">Tylenol murders&amp;lt;/a>. If they had spun it the way Intel spun the FDIV problem, or the way Google and Facebook are spinning the NSA crisis, they would have said something like this: "It's a local problem in Chicago. Only a few of our customers have been effected. We are taking steps to make sure that there's a low probability of any other customers being similarly inconvenienced."	What a customer would think: "These guys are clueless. I'd better go with Bayer or Excedrin. I don't want to die just because I had a headache."	Instead, what Tylenol did, and it's something the tech companies would be well-advised to &amp;lt;a href="http://www.ou.edu/deptcomm/dodjcc/groups/02C2/Johnson%20&amp;%20Johnson.htm">study&amp;lt;/a>, is to approach the problem the way their customers would. They immediately withdrew every bottle of Tylenol on dealer's shelves, everywhere. The first goal was to protect the people, &amp;lt;i>then&amp;lt;/i> save the product. Which they did, after taking the hit, and on the way to becoming the leader in product safety. The product came back stronger than it was before. 	Applied to this situation, it would have been smart for the companies to have prepared, by taking steps to blunt the negative effect on their users because of the government intrusion. Sure they had to comply, but did they have to leave the customers so vulnerable? Of course not. They couldn't warn us, that would have been illegal (unfortunately) but they could have made sure that more of the data resided in places that wouldn't be so convenient for the government to monitor. That's the equivalent of Johnson &amp; Johnson putting tamper-proof packaging on Tylenol. Two excellent mob films starring Robert De Niro	I love it when people turn me on to excellent fun movies I haven't seen before. In that spirit here are two that are sure to delight if you like the same kinds of movies I do. They both star Robert De Niro. And both are very long, but hold your attention.	1. &amp;lt;a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9801E1D6143BF932A35755C0A962948260">Once Upon a Time in America&amp;lt;/a> is a &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_Western">spaghetti&amp;lt;/a> mob movie written and directed by &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Leone">Sergio Leone&amp;lt;/a>. It takes place in a Jewish ghetto in lower Manhattan, in a period spanning 50 years or so starting at the beginning of the 20th century. It's a weird movie for sure, and it goes slowly, almost like poetry. But the acting is first rate, and the story is compelling.  It's actually two stories interwoven. 	2. &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/22/movies/film-review-a-money-mad-mirage-from-scorsese.html">Casino&amp;lt;/a> is like Goodfellas 2, with different characters, but many of the same actors. Directed by Martin Scorcese, the plot comes from a book by the same &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pileggi">author&amp;lt;/a> who wrote &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodfellas">Goodfellas&amp;lt;/a>. Stars De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. Set in Las Vegas. Same narration style as Goodfellas, though there are two protagonists.	Also James Woods is in both movies, playing a leading role in #1 and a minor one in #2. 	Also interesting, De Niro plays a Jew in both movies.Google, Twitter and Facebook, et al have a way out	It's great that there's a discussion online today about whether or not the tech companies had a way to resist the US govt, if they believed that it was wrong to share information about their users without users knowing. 	There is a way around it. They could reverse the process of centralizing user information on their servers.	When they found the web, Google, Twitter and Facebook, it was a completely decentralized network from a content standpoint.		(It's never been decentralized at a transport level. There are several main peering points, and the name system is a hierarchy.)	Google and Facebook could have, together, easily defined new standards for distributing information in ways that would make it harder for the government to tap in. At least they could have avoided being responsible for it themselves. 	Or they could have been supportive of standards that decentralize, like one that's dear to me -- RSS. Instead they undermined it. In Google's case, in a fairly horrific way. Did they ever say they'd never come back to RSS if we manage to reboot it after cleaning up their mess? A mess that they offered absolutely no help with. 	Twitter had the biggest opportunity to create a free-flowing federated network of free users. They could have given us a new layer the way the web did in 1992. Instead, they sucked in all the energy created by developers and did the same thing the others did -- centralized. Goodbye freedom. Hello NSA.	They brought this on, &amp;lt;i>they're&amp;lt;/i> the cause of the mess we're in now. 	I have no sympathy for them. They could still get out of the hotseat. There would be nothing illegal about them telling the world that they made a huge mistake by centralizing everything, and now they're going to reverse the process. They don't have to say what the consequences of that mistake are, we all know, thanks to Glenn Greenwald.	What could the government do? They'd be alone.	Of course, no one in their right mind believes they would do it.	Because having the govt as a partner, as Citibank and Chase found out, is a great business plan. &amp;lt;i>Too big to fail&amp;lt;/i> now clearly applies in tech too. A Google Now story	An example of how good/creepy Google Now is. 	My friend Jen was coming to visit from SLC. Google Now told me her plane was 24 minutes from arriving at the gate at JFK. I had never told them she was visiting me or what flight she was on (I didn't know). But they did. Probably because she uses Gmail or their calendar, and somehow connected me to that trip (or did they just guess!) and thought I might be impressed if they told me about her flight. I was!	And I felt a little nausea, as I realized they have me by the balls and don't mind if I know it.Morning coffee notes	&amp;lt;rules (blogSectionsRules)>	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;font-family>Georgia&amp;lt;/font-family>			&amp;lt;font-size>19px&amp;lt;/font-size>			&amp;lt;line-height>150%&amp;lt;/line-height>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	Arrington nails it		&amp;lt;a href="http://uncrunched.com/2013/06/06/triangulating-on-truth-the-totalitarian-state/">Mike Arrington&amp;lt;/a> who is a lawyer, has what almost certainly is an accurate read on the denials from Silicon Valley companies on how they're supporting the NSA. Read their exact words. They're not technically lying but they are providing the government with all the information they want. It's a good must-read.	Not interested in NBA Finals		I got through the first half of last night's Game 1, and it was late and I was tired, and I didn't care who won. For me, basketball isn't  about the skill of the players, it's the story. So when a player or a team I admire does something wonderful it presses a button for me. These two teams are no doubt the best teams in the 2013 NBA, and I'm sure the one who wins will deserve the victory. But I would care much more if the Rockets, Warriors or Pacers were facing off against one of the established giants. Then there would be drama, and that's what gets me going.	People are up about the NSA		I don't think there's much we can do about the situation with the NSA getting access to all our online stuff. That was all decided as people shrugged off the dominance of the Internet by a few giant companies. Users said they could do what they want and didn't have to worry about the big picture. We argued, they called us idealists. You guys care about that stuff, we don't. Well now the chickens have come to roost as a famous preacher once said. This is what happens when you let Zuck have all your stuff. 		I don't think it's too late for us as a species, but it's getting there. The real battle isn't the battle for privacy or freedom, it's for survival. There's no doubt that climate change is real. We're destroying the atmosphere of our home. And we have no Plan B. 		So if you're waking up, let's go -- let's work together to start solving real problems we have now. I think if we're doing that, the spooks won't be able to stop us, and I don't think they'll &amp;lt;i>want&amp;lt;/i> to. Why? Because they live on this planet too. They're people not that different from you and I. Esp if you are a computer geek.		I bet quite a few of them even read this site. ;--)The human wave	&amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/342691088789827584">1&amp;lt;/a>. It's just hitting me now that in the new tech industry the person counts for nothing. It's the aggregate that matters. The human wave.	&amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/342691212786036736">2&amp;lt;/a>. And that is the exact opposite of what interested me in tech. I got involved because of &amp;lt;i>personal&amp;lt;/i> computers. The individual is everything.The Michael Jordan of X	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/06/06/michaelJordan.gif" width="160" height="198" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named michaelJordan.gif">I turned 58 last month, and that means we're getting within striking distance of 60. Actually &amp;lt;i>I'm&amp;lt;/i> getting within striking distance of 60. It's a bit of a shock, actually. Inside I feel 19. Or maybe 30. But 58? 60. OMG. Ohhh.	But Monday night just before &amp;lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/06/03/188501925/heat-win-east-title-in-game-7-beat-pacers-99-76">Game 7&amp;lt;/a> of the Eastern Division Championship, I solved a problem that I had been thinking about for at least 20 years. It had to do with templating in content management systems. It came to me as we re-approached a problem I had approached several times before in earlier products. This time, I saw the way around the conundrum that had evaded me before. I don't think this is because I'm smarter than I was when I was 38 or 48, rather it's because I have the 20 years of experience that I didn't have then.	The next little bit is a story that is &amp;lt;i>not&amp;lt;/i> about the people involved, Fred Wilson, John Doerr and Michael Jordan, it's illustrative. I have the greatest respect and admiration for all three of them, not just for their accomplishments in the past, but for what they are doing today. All three are very much alive. And all three are still taking chances, learning, and doing new things. 	&amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fredwilson/status/340832622940938241">On Twitter&amp;lt;/a>, I saw Wilson refer to Doerr as &amp;lt;i>The Michael Jordan of VC. &amp;lt;/i>Something bothered me about this. So I pondered it and realized the problem. How I got there was by changing some of the names, a couple of times and thinking in analogies.	1. I imagined Matt Mullenweg saying I was &amp;lt;i>The Michael Jordan of Software.&amp;lt;/i> This wasn't hard, because Matt said something &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/06/06/matt.gif">similar&amp;lt;/a> a few weeks ago. No doubt said with genuine admiration, it exposed something inside that's imho incorrect. He said that it's amazing that I keep writing software, many years after I no longer had to. I imagine when Matt looks at me, he hopes that he will have the drive to create when he's my age (he's about 30 years younger than me). But I'd rather if Matt ignored my age and my financial circumstances, and looked at the actual software I'm writing -- today -- not in the past. I would prefer if he said: I think Dave's new software is interesting, but I don't understand it. Or I think Dave's software is revolutionary and it will have impact on all software being developed today. Or something that reflected my status as an active player, maybe even an active &amp;lt;i>superstar.&amp;lt;/i> But I think conventional thinking shuts off that train of thought. 		And btw, if you look to basketball as an example, the young guys always study the work of people who came before them. The young Knick Iman Schumpert is a great example and inspiration. In an interview I saw him explain in great detail the players who he was borrowing style from. In tech, we tend to throw all that away. We won't always do it, as the art matures we'll understand that we're borrowing from the past, and then become receptive to learning from prior art. But first we have to cure ourselves of the idea that people are obsolete so early. Even basketball, where the bodies can't compete after 40, manages to use the skill and experience of the veterans, as coaches, advisers, trainers. 		Also, I know that what Matt said was a compliment. But it also had meaning. It's possible for something to be both a compliment and worth examining. 	2. I had an experience on Twitter with Joshua Benton, someone who I admire and think highly of, who I know hasn't used my new software. This came up in a discussion. I more or less asked him to check out my software before declaring blogging dead. It may not have sounded like that to him and it may have been said more awkwardly (140 char limit). His response was like Matt's. I was using your software in 1990 he said. Nice. So I'm &amp;lt;i>The Michael Jordan of Software.&amp;lt;/i> But I'm not because I'm still pushing it. Inventing new ways to approach the rim. New ways to stun and amaze. But you'll never see it if you don't look.		My dream is that Benton would do 1/4 the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/08/13-ways-of-looking-at-medium-the-new-bloggingsharingdiscovery-platform-from-ev-and-obvious/">analysis&amp;lt;/a> he did of Evan Williams' new software. I think I've earned a good look, and some thought. 	3. And that led me to the final analogy that nailed it. What if LeBron James said that Tim Duncan is &amp;lt;i>The Michael Jordan of Basketball.&amp;lt;/i> Wishful thinking! The two men are about to face off in a classic series of the ages in the NBA finals. Game 1 is tonight. It's the old sin of sport and business. Don't celebrate until you win. That's a good way to inspire the competition and undermine your fighting spirit. We saw that happen &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/may/swattingAwayFlies">with the Knicks&amp;lt;/a> this season, when JR Smith, thinking the Knicks had won, celebrated by elbowing an opponent. In the face! He was suspended for a game (that the Knicks lost), and more importantly threw his energy out the window. The Knicks were embarassed by the Indiana Pacers in a short series that they never really were in. And Smith was in a funk the rest of the short Knicks run. Every Knicks fan knows this story. ;-(	I learn a lot from sports, I really do. I think it's an incredible teacher of human spirit, in a very compact form. Things that may take years or even decades to play out in tech, often happen in just a few minutes in an NBA playoff game. 	If I were Matt, I would watch that attitude. Because Old Dave might still have a trick or two. Software is not like basketball in that way. I have no stake in the competition between Doerr and Wilson (I assume they still see each other as competitiors). I will root for Doerr now, because I always like an underdog, the same way I rooted for Wilson when he was coming up. And tonight I will definitely be rooting for the Spurs and Tim Duncan, even though LeBron was smart enough not to make any grandiose claims about the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsolescence">obsolescence&amp;lt;/a> of his rival. ;-)Let's not repeat the Google Reader mistake	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/06/05/drum.gif" width="135" height="112" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named drum.gif">We're getting ready to do the blogging part of our software at Small Picture. We've done a review of the evolution of my own blog, Scripting News, over the years. It was good to go over it, because it became clear that as Google Reader came to dominate in feed reading, it forced my blog, and presumably many others, to conform to its limits. Features were removed from my blog because they confused Google Reader. And when we tried to reach out to them, the answer was that they didn't have enough people on their team to listen. When that I happened I knew we were in a bad place. 	But now we're seeing a rebirth of blogging software, other people have noted it, not just me. And along with it, later in the process, perhaps we can have a rebirth of feed aggregators. But we can't do it if a single company dominates the reader market. Yet some reports indicate that's where we're going. 	I have a plan, if that should happen, if on July 1 we substitute one dominant feed reader for another. My products will produce full-fidelity RSS, that gives us and our users the chance to be fully creative, as we were in the early days of blogging and feed-reading. We won't try to live within the limits of a dominant feed reader. If they can't read our feeds, sorry. 	Users say "oh we're just users we can do what we want." That's nice, but not true. It's like saying I'm a car driver, I don't care about climate change, so I can burn as much fuel as I want. Yeah, I suppose it's true. There is no law that limits the amount of carbon you burn. But someday you or your kids will not be able to breathe. Same with RSS and blogging. If you want to keep using this stuff, you can't just repeat the same mistake. The new dominant player may be very nice, the people may have good hearts, and mean well, but they might be holding back innovation -- or worse, as Google was, taking out innovation and forcing a kind of dull no-growth uniformity. Writers, designers and programmers	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/06/04/drummer.gif" width="125" height="228" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 35px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named drummer.gif">Writers can write in spaces we control, or we can write in spaces others control. We can spread our writing around, so one story appears in many places, or we can put each story in one place and distribute pointers to it. 	There are tradeoffs. If I write a piece and post it on Huffington or Medium, the theory is that it gets more circulation, our ideas get more exposure, or we get some kind of reputation benefit. Medium is a place where good writers write. Therefore if my story appears there, that leaves an impression that I'm a good writer. Huffington makes it look like I'm a journalist. Same with Forbes these days. But the reps quickly catch up with facts. Pretty much anyone can have an account on any of these systems. And as soon as you see a crude rant show up on one of them, you understand that the name isn't about quality anymore. The value in the name dissipates quickly. 	I've written for several of these pubs, and I don't think my stories get any more play there than they do &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/june/writersDesignersAndProgrammers">here&amp;lt;/a>, on my blog. 	Huffington plays games with flow. If you ever get a hit story, they use it to deliver flow to stories written by their own people on that topic. Now that hardly seems fair, given that they don't reciprocate by delivering flow to your less popular stories. When this happened, when I had a hit on Huffington, that was the last time I posted anything there. 	When you think about it, if these guys are smart, it &amp;lt;i>has&amp;lt;/i> to be that way. They're not going to let big flow come into their servers without monetizing it. So if you don't get much flow from them for your so-so articles and if they siphon off flow from your hits, why  should put your work there? It's not a good deal.	Medium has a slightly different proposition. I have put a few stories there over the last few months, some of my best pieces (they got me to think about them that way -- good for them), but they didn't get any more flow than they did here. They have an excellent stats system so you can see. Their hook is that their tools are nice and HTML5-pretty. They feel good to write with. That's nice. But could you get the same thing outside of Medium? Of course. This is not hard to do. But, key point, we have to work together, to iterate there. 	If good writers work with good designers and programmers we can keep building so that independence continues to be the basic value of the web. Otherwise we're returning the independence we got from the web to another generation of AOLs. 	That's the writer's story. Programmers have a similar one. The web is where we don't have our work controlled by Apple or Google, where we can create exactly what we want for our users. The stuff we believe they'll love. For example one of the most popular features in my new product Fargo would be disallowed if we tried to push it through Apple's store. That's why it's written in JavaScript and runs in a browser. 	I think that if you're a writer, you're hurting your own interest by not working with independent designers and programmers, long-term. And the leaders, the people who advise other writers on what they should be doing, I think they're hurting us even more by leading the parade into the new AOLs. Same with teachers of writers.	This isn't about any one writer, designer or programmer, it's about all of us. Remember how far the open web has taken us. Let's not abandon it now. It can keep delivering, but only if we work together and feed our creativity and passion into it. 	Writers, designers and programmers. FTW! :-)Servermatrix becomes IBM	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/06/04/grandpa.gif" width="95" height="249" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named grandpa.gif">About ten years go, seriously, I signed up at &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=servermatrix">Servermatrix&amp;lt;/a> and created three or four servers. The first podcasting servers were there. Podmonster1 and 2 I think were their names. A lot of the old UserLand sites are still running there.	Servermatrix was something of a breakthrough in its day. Previously, to get hosting, I had to buy a box and colocate it at some place with good net connectivity, electricity, air conditioning, etc. What they did was make renting a server almost as easy as buying something on Amazon.	I still have one server running there, with all the stuff I'm too &amp;lt;s>busy&amp;lt;/s> lazy to port.	Then a few years ago Servermatrix got bought by a company called &amp;lt;a href="http://www.softlayer.com/">Softlayer&amp;lt;/a>. 	Their emails were a little different, but I just let them charge my credit card, and tried to forget about the server still running there. Mostly I was able to do that.	Then this morning I got an email saying Softlayer was &amp;lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/softlayer.html">bought by IBM&amp;lt;/a>.	Now I have a server at IBM. 	Not a big deal, just worth observing.NYT redesign	Over the last few days or weeks, not sure, I've noticed a new very readable look to articles on the NYT website. Very welcome change. Then this morning I noticed that there's an extensive navigation system in the left sidebar. Only thing I'd like better is if they had an outliner interface for it, that I could expand/collapse my way through. Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/06/03/nytredesign.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a> showing the opinion section open to show the columnists. Three panels. How to cut down on flopping	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/06/02/clyde.gif" width="161" height="258" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named clyde.gif">The NBA added rules at the beginning of the 2012-2013 season that were intended to cut down on &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flop_(basketball)">flopping&amp;lt;/a>. 		Flopping is when a player acts, convincingly, as if he's been fouled. 		It's a form of acting. 		When viewed on replay sometimes there's absolutely no contact, but it looks like there was. 		The flopping player goes down, clutching his head, rolling over repeatedly, to call attention to the "offense" by the refs. 	Not sure how well it worked during the regular season, but it's not working in the playoffs. The stakes are so high, the players are willing to pay the fines if it means they can get a call to go their way. These games are often so close that a single possession can determine the outcome. 	It's probably even become part of the strategy of the game, and it's easy to imagine the coaches and the players, talking about it privately of course, maybe even in coded language.	But if the coaches were penalized along with the players, it would likely curtail the flopping, maybe even stop it, esp if suspensions were added to the penalty, earlier in the process.	It would change the dynamics if the coach could get suspended. It would mean that if the coach thought the player was doing it, he wouldn't put him in the game. It would get the coach on the side of the league and the fans, in stopping the practice. 	And the financial penalties would matter more to the coach, because they pay them for every player, and coaches don't make as much as the players do. Second CitiBike ride	I took my second ride today, this time checking in at the station at 54th and 8th Ave.	I knew how to do it this time, so I was out of there in no time.	I forgot to adjust the seat. Stopped a few blocks into the ride and did so.	However, the seat didn't stay up. I had to stop every few blocks to yank it back up.	Eventually I got tired of this and just left it low. I felt like an adult riding a kid's bike.	I guess that's the big question, how well will the system hold up against NYC wear and tear. Everything is still bright and shiny, but eventually it's going to be like everything else in NYC, functional but not too clean. ;-)	We love NY, yes we do. But...	The second ride was not as much fun as the &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/may/myRideOnACitibike">first&amp;lt;/a>.Workflowy supports OPML!	I just got a &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/april/workflowyAndLittleOutliner#comment-915791062">note&amp;lt;/a> from Ulf Gjerdingen saying that Workflowy now supports OPML.	I had to check it out.	So I went to my outline in &amp;lt;a href="http://workflowy.com/">Workflowy&amp;lt;/a>.

I am not the story, nor am I even part of it. And maybe he or she doesn't want to pick it up. But they are losing out if there's no way to send them a quick note, from someone they probably don't know (me).	My hope is that the reporter I want to reach will post an item to this thread and I'll thereby get their email address and be able to get this idea out to them. :-)It's amazing anyone uses Google+	Just read this &amp;lt;a href="http://www.ryocentral.info/2012/03/google-makes-big-misktake-with-api.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">piece&amp;lt;/a> that reminds me that not only does Google not allow posting from apps other than Google+, it also doesn't have feeds so there's no way to get your stuff out.	I don't know what they're doing at Google, but they're going the wrong way with this stuff. 	My systems have feeds coming out and can be wired up to other systems to integrate their input.	We still have more work to do but everything is aimed toward being open pipes on both end. 	Someday one of these companies will try to build a coral reef and will reap huge gains.Should journalists play roles in movies?	Lately I've been noticing more journalists appearing in movies that are essentially fiction, or totally fiction. 	This &amp;lt;i>feels&amp;lt;/i> like an ethical breech. A journalist is not an actor. Playing a fictional role, as yourself, with your name, your TV network, feels wrong. 	I'm having a hard time putting my finger on why this is.	Perhaps it's that it makes one question when you're watching them do their real job if it's acting or if they're trying to be a real journalist. Or if they're just &amp;lt;i>playing&amp;lt;/i> one (as they are in the movie).	Do you have an opinion?&lt;/pre>March 2013 = &lt;pre>Why don't programmers speak for programming?	I've been watching for this for a few weeks. When public discourse turns to programming, the people who speak are people who don't program for a living. Sure some of them took computer science classes in college, or at one time were professional coders. But not people who &amp;lt;i>today&amp;lt;/i> do it as their primary thing. In &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/whyYouShouldLearnToCode">one&amp;lt;/a> particularly egregious case, they were quoting NBA players on why you should learn to code! That is so weird.	So why is this? I think I finally figured it out, and it was the NBA connection that did it for me. Programmers don't generally speak in politically correct terms. And we don't have many, if any, spokes models who will talk in vague enough terms to be sure that they will never actually say anything meaningful. This disqualifies us from participating in public discussions. We simply can't be trusted to never say anything we mean.	Maybe that's not it? But I don't like it. I'd like to see some developers be heard. I'd like to just once nod my head and say yeah that person knows what they're talking about when it comes to technology. The creepiest April 1 web page?	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/McFarlane-Toys-Series-Stoudemire-Action/dp/B00483KC9O/ref=sr_1_5?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364735786&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=mcfarlane+toys+basketball+knicks">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/31/amare.gif" width="125" height="236" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named amare.gif">&amp;lt;/a>The worst tradition of the net is the April Fools news article.	I have something to announce.

Are you prepared to believe it? 	It would be good if we were all more circumspect about what we read.	But journalists joking about inaccuracy in their reporting is like a surgeon leaving his or her lunch in your chest.

Fred Wilson is to developers what &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/04/nyregion/spike-lee-to-stick-with-his-knicks.html?pagewanted=all">Spike Lee&amp;lt;/a> is to the Knicks. The guy who shows up at every game and roots the team on, through thick and thin, no matter if they start a Brooklyn team (Lee is also a cultural icon of Brooklyn). He loves the orange and blue uniforms of the Knicks and Madison Square Garden. Only in this sport, the fan is confused for the great player by the opinion leaders and gatekeepers. As if all there were to being a champion is having a lot of money (you might argue the opposite is true, the most interesting players are the ones who don't have any money, but hunger for recognition).	The Board of Ed liked the idea so much they stole it and usurped it, and now instead of creating great young talent to flow into Fred's NY startups, they'll create Certified Cisco maintenence guys. Or people who can keep Windows networks running as long as Microsoft is making them. Or Oracle databases.	The fight is a familiar one. Should we create hackers for Wall Street or for the nascent high tech startup industry that's trying to get a foothold in NYC. Fred of course wants the flow for Foursquare and Stack Exchange and Etsy etc. And Bloomberg wants them for Chase, Citibank and the Department of Sanitation. 	There is a third possibility. Tell the captains of finance to back off, and let's create some developers who are capable of taking us in new directions. Not into Wilson's companies or Bloomberg's. 	Not much chance of that of course. ;-)	So we'll still have Spike Lee coaching the team. Let's keep everything on a steady predictable course. As long as it makes me richer. (Paraphrasing.)	New York has always been run for the benefit of the already-rich at the expense of the gifted artist. Maybe it's not true in every art, but it totally so in the art of creating great world-changing software. In a few years when these kids are ready to work there will be a new league, and no one is prepared today to teach them the skills they will need for that. So it doesn't matter much who controls the curriculum. The really smart ones will figure it out. And they will surprise us and teach us a lot. (And if there's any sanity we will get to teach them a thing or two as well.)	PS: I went to Bronx Science, which is an elite public school, like Stuyvesant. Neither they nor I discovered, while I was a student there, that I had a talent for tech, and my media hacking was seen as a social behavior problem. So I don't have a lot of faith in the idea of elite NYC high schools. However, the students taught each other a lot, and we created our own fun. Which is kind of what I'm getting at in this piece. 	PPS: In addition to teaching kids how to be great commercial developers, I'd teach them how to create open systems without lock-in. That's the equivalent of the scientific method for software design. Schools have an obligation to teach the idealism of art, not only the craft. I'm on the web team	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/30/cable.gif" width="145" height="89" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named cable.gif">Any company that takes content off the web and puts it in a private silo is playing on its own team. There are lots of companies doing this, so there are lots of teams. I'm on the team that puts all the content on the web. That means that every bit can have an address. That means it can all be plugged into other applications. So our work multiplies. The value of ideas deposited on the web is much greater than ideas that are trapped in a silo. There are lots of people, companies, universities, libraries, open source projects and governments in "web team" space. It may seem naive for any single company to throw its lot in with us, but when you see the full picture, you see it's actually the other way around. What we create together can be much much bigger than anything a single company can do. 	PS: &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&amp;lt;/a> is on the web team too. ;-)Ten-year Berkman Thursday reunion meetup on April 25	It's been 10 years since the Berkman-Thursday group started, and with it, blogging at Harvard. It all happened at the same time Facebook was booting up on campus. 	It was an &amp;lt;a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggroup/about/">informal group&amp;lt;/a> that met at &amp;lt;a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center&amp;lt;/a> every Thursday evening. Our goal was to boot up a blogging community at the university and in the surrounding community. It was the first university at the time to offer blogging. We needed a way to create a pulse, a weekly event that was open to anyone where you could learn about blogging, and we could learn from each other. 	It evolved in a number of directions. New software came out of the group. We planned and succesfully ran the first blogging conferences in the US. We taught a lot of people how to blog. And the sessions themselves were a lot like blog posts. Someone comes in with an idea, talks about it, we ask questions and discuss it. We discussed the things we were writing on our blogs. 	The group continued running as a weekly seminar series until a couple of years ago. 	Now we're approaching the 10th anniversary and some of the members have expressed an interest in a reunion. I've asked for space at Berkman, and they got pretty excited about the idea, so we're having a &amp;lt;i>Old Timers Day&amp;lt;/i> meetup on April 25 at Berkman Center at 7PM, &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=23+Everett+St,+Cambridge,+MA&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=40.697488,-73.979681&amp;sspn=1.086989,1.274414&amp;oq=23+everett+St,+cam&amp;hnear=23+Everett+St,+Cambridge,+Middlesex,+Massachusetts+02138&amp;t=m&amp;z=17">23 Everett Street&amp;lt;/a>. 	We'll talk about what we've been doing, what we learned, how life evolved in the last ten years, what we got right and what we got wrong, and what role the Thursday evening meetings played for us. I will also show off the software I've been developing, Little Outliner and other goodies. Some of them will already be shipping by the end of April. ;-) 	There should be room for 25-30 people. I've set up an Eventbrite page. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://berkmanthursday2013.eventbrite.com/">http://berkmanthursday2013.eventbrite.com/&amp;lt;/a>	Hope to see you in Cambridge on April 25. 	PS: Here's the archive of Scripting News for &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/2003/03.html">March 2003&amp;lt;/a>. You'll see a lot of the developments at Berkman recorded there. I'm not making blogging tools :-)	First, I really appreciate &amp;lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/28/watch-out-internet-dave-winer-is-back-in-the-business-of-making-blogging-tools/">Mathew Ingram's writeup&amp;lt;/a> in Gigaom about what we're doing at &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/">Small Picture&amp;lt;/a>. If you haven't read it, and you're a regular here, go read it now. Lots of good stuff. ;-)	However.. (you knew that was coming)	We are not making blogging tools. 	We are making software for creative people -- writers, designers and programmers. Inevitably that means it will connect to blogging systems, because blogs are fixtures in the world of 2013 and beyond. And it's certainly possible that one can create a blogging system using our backend (not released yet). But our business is not what his headline says it is.	Mathew is totally entitled to his interpretation. 	And of course I'm entitled to comment on his interpretation. :-)	Why this is important?	1. Our product should not be evalutated based on its capability as a blogging tool.	2. We see blogging products as complementary to ours, not competitive.	3. I even made a &amp;lt;a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/349109119cee">proposition&amp;lt;/a> to vendors of blogging tools, and the offer is still open (and I will make it again, in new contexts as the software develops).	I want to make great editing tools, for writers, designers and programmers. 	That's our mantra, at least one of them. ;-)	And finally thanks to Mathew for such a thoughtful and otherwise accurate piece.	PS: I can totally see why it's confusing, esp based on some of the things I've said. I will try to be more careful about that! :-)Make a Twitter out of RSS	As developers rush to fill the Google Reader hole, it seems everyone is trying to reproduce Google Reader, almost verbatim. It's understandable. There are a huge number of fans of Google Reader who will be without  Google Reader as of July 1. So when they tell you what they want, it's no surprise that what they come up with is basically, Google Reader.	I think/hope they will be well-served. 	But there's an opportunity to do something different that might be equally interesting. Without asking users what they want, create a product based on a different hypothesis.		A famous platform vendor once &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/2001/01/03.html#aStory">asked&amp;lt;/a> me if the users were asking for ThinkTank, my first product, before I created it. He had a point. There were no users before there was a product. So they couldn't ask. Because they didn't exist.	The hypothesis: What if Twitter were, in every way, open. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/28/rssTShirt.gif" width="150" height="150" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named rssTShirt.gif">What would that look like?	1. First, it would look like Twitter. There would be a box at the top of the page that asks What's Happening, and below that a sequence of new items from people you follow, in reverse-chronologic order.	2. It would be easy to follow someone. When you're looking at their profile page, there would be a big easy to see button that says Follow. It would not say Follow in Product X or Follow in Product Y, etc. It would not open up a huge dialog with a list of products you could follow it in. It would say Follow. And when you click it you Follow that person. No questions asked.	3. It's a web app. No synchronization among different clients. Supply an API if you like. But like Twitter it's always reverse-chronologic, and it doesn't remember what you haven't read. Yes, some users won't like that. They will use the other kind of RSS app, the ones that synch between clients. (See the first paragraph of this piece.)	4. No lock-in. That's where it gets tricky. But it's a different kind of tricky than the people cloning Google Reader will encounter. Over there, you have to synchronize news items among lots of possible clients. Here you have to let the user tell you where she stores her subscriptions (and that will determine who gets the message when the user clicks on the Follow button). Beyond that, every developer could experiment with different scanning possibilities, and different presentations, and different whatevers.	This is my dream system. I would happily make components for it. I'm just one user, for sure, and you might have to think a bit more to do this one vs the straight Google Reader clone. But there's also more opportunity to innovate. And it won't just be a repeat of the last 8 years.Me, in 1996	A picture &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tpoholmes/sets/72157633089256151/">Tim Holmes&amp;lt;/a> dug up, taken at Apple in 1996, the night Steve Jobs returned from exile. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tpoholmes/8590667121/in/set-72157633089256151/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/dave1996.jpg" width="325" height="302" border="0" alt="A picture named dave1996.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>	I heard about the event by word of mouth and decided to drive down there to witness it. Walked right in, no security -- I even brought a date with me. ;-)	No gray in my beard. ;-)An open note to tech press/bloggers	We just did a great rollout, the &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">product&amp;lt;/a> is fantastic. This is going to move tech in a new direction. It'll create new standards. I'm absolutely sure of it.	Yet, even with my track record as one who leads change in technology, the release of this software has gotten almost no note from leading tech bloggers and reporters.	That's okay, because it'll happen without them. Last time I pushed something through, it didn't get support from the press either. And the time before that. We &amp;lt;i>can&amp;lt;/i> make it happen without their help.	I think they're comfortable with big software ideas coming from big companies. But I can't make change happen within the context of a big corporation. Too much second-guessing, too many strategy taxes, too many phony business models. So I choose to do it as an independent. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/bike.gif" width="145" height="88" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named bike.gif">I think software is like other creative arts -- music, architecture, cooking, even design of everyday things like bikes and clothes. It takes a relentless focus on the act of using, and what kind of effect you want to create. Learning from others, and stealing from the best. Only. ;-)	We can do it on our own but it would be &amp;lt;i>easier&amp;lt;/i> if we got help from influencers and gatekeepers. So if you like anything that I helped bring about, blogging, RSS and podcasting and a few other things, please have a look at &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&amp;lt;/a>. It's a little product, yes -- but one with very big ambitions. ;-)	These are early days, the &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">product&amp;lt;/a> is very simple, and well-&amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/outlinerHowto.html">documented&amp;lt;/a>.

He was disappointed that when you press Cmd-A it only selects the siblings at the same level as the bar cursor headline. He felt it should select all the text in the outline.	My answer was that like almost every operation in an outliner, select-all is &amp;lt;i>scoped.&amp;lt;/i> When you select a headline, you are implicitly selecting all the headlines that are subordinate to it. So if you want to select everything in an outline, move the cursor to one of the summits, and do the select-all there. 	This is fundamentally different from the way a word processor or spreadsheet works, but it's exactly the way the Finder or Windows Explorer works, which are also scoped. When you select-all in a folder, it doesn't select all the files on your computer -- it just selects the files in the folder you're working in. 	Why does it work this way? Well, an outline can logically contain many documents, not just one. For example, I'm writing this blog post in an outline that contains all my posts dating back to March of last year. If I did a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/selectAllInBlogPost.gif">select-all here&amp;lt;/a>, I'd want it to select all the text in this post, not all the text in all posts. However if I wanted to select everything, I could do that, by putting the cursor on the top level headline, as illustrated in this &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/selectAllTop.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a>.HTML 5 local storage FAQ	&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/26/html5.gif" width="125" height="125" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named html5.gif">&amp;lt;/a>After a few thousand people looked at &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&amp;lt;/a> yesterday, it's clear that some users are uncomfortable with the idea of local  storage. For many, apparently this is the first time they have encoutered this HTML 5 feature. 	I looked for a user-oriented FAQ on local storage but all I found were descriptions of the feature for developers. And for developers, there really isn't that much to know. I've put the details under this headline, you can expand it if you care.		There's a new browser object called localStorage. It behaves like any other JavaScript object except it persists. That means the next time the user comes back to your site, the storage will still be there, exactly as it was last time they visited.		In most browsers the object is attached to a single domain, so joe.userland.com and mary.userland.com will have different localStorage objects. Apparently Firefox is different, in that joe and mary share a localStorage object. There are reasons to do it either way. It would be nice if they all did it the &amp;lt;i>same&amp;lt;/i> way. ;-)	So here are some answers to frequently asked question.	1. Where is local storage stored? It varies from browser to browser. Some users have explored in the system settings folders on various operating systems and found the files. They look like they're SQL databases. 	2. How much space does it use? The per-domain limit is 5MB.	3. When you clear the cache does local storage get cleared too? I don't know. 	4. Isn't local storage like cookies? Yes, it's very much like cookies, except cookies are limited to 4K, and local storage can go up to 5MB. The difference in size reflects the difference in times. When cookies were invented, in the mid-90s, computers had a lot less memory. Today it's not uncommon for a new computer to have a terabyte of disk space. 5MB today is like what 4K was back then. It seems silly to live in a world limited by the machines of the past. But cookies couldn't change without risking breakage, of the web itself. So local storage was a good answer. Also local storage is simpler to program than cookies, but not so much simpler as to make a huge difference.	5. Isn't this a potentially dangerous feature? We are very responsible about our software, we just want people to make outlines and be happy and want to use the new stuff we come out with. This is a business for us. So we would never use it in a harmful way. Not only would it be against our interest, but it would be professionally unthinkable. That said, localStorage &amp;lt;i>is&amp;lt;/i> a potentially dangerous feature, in the hands of a malicious website. This is something the browser vendors will probably have to address sooner or later. Probably sooner. ;-)	6. How can I get rid of what you stored on my computer? I can only answer for our product. If you delete all the text in your outline, that will get rid of most of what we store. There will still be an empty outline in local storage, and a count of the number of times you saved. That takes up about 140 characters, or coincidentally, the size of a tweet. If even this is too much to bear, we can add a way for you to delete that too. (I imagine someone will say that it is, so I'm already preparing to write the code.)	If you have other questions, ask them below and we'll try to answer them, the best we can.The magic of HTML 5 and S3	We just shipped a &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">new product&amp;lt;/a>, promoted the hell out of it (with great results, thanks!), the site is getting huge traffic, but our server is as quiet as it was yesterday. 	Because this web app uses no server resources. ;-)	That's the magic of HTML 5 &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/usersGuideToLocalStorage">local storage&amp;lt;/a>, and static pages on S3. 	Thanks to the W3C and to Werner Vogels (for persisting in getting the ability to access the root of a domain from an S3 bucket). As a result, we get unlimited scaling with zero investment. Consider this an endorsement for both innovations. 	Now, that said, in future incarnations, we will have a server component, and scaling &amp;lt;i>will&amp;lt;/i> be an issue. But for right now we can bask in the glory. ;-)My new company, our first product	Good morning!	A quick note with some news.	1. In December I started a new company, &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/">Small Picture&amp;lt;/a>, with Kyle Shank, a 28-year-old JavaScript developer. 	2. We've created a new product, &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&amp;lt;/a>. It runs in-browser. It's a continuation of the thread started by my desktop outliner products. It is in every way as easy, smooth and powerful as the earlier Mac and PC outliners. JavaScript plus HTML 5 is an amazing platform.	3. Little Outliner is a new beginning. Our easy on-ramp. We want to re-introduce idea processing, and using outliners to create presentations, but this time the difference is networking. I think you'll be amazed at what we come up with in the coming months. I haven't been this excited about a product since we shipped MORE at Living Videotext in 1986. Not kidding.	4. Working with a smart young dude like Kyle, who knows so much about the modern technologies, has been a real awakening for me. I've learned how to apply my craft in what is a very strange world. JavaScript is not like any language I've ever used. This product is very much the result of a creative partnership. As we grow we'll add other excellent developers. Like all my companies, Small Picture will create user-focused products, that offer choice, value, performance and interop with others. No lock-in here, other than what comes from happy users. 	Thanks for reading this far. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. We'll try our best to answer them quickly.	Dave Winer&amp;lt;br>Small Picture, Inc.It's an outliner!	On Monday of this week, somewhat quietly, we released the docs for the &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/doYouLoveOutliners">outliner&amp;lt;/a> we've been developing at Small Picture, Inc.	&amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/outlinerHowto.html">http://smallpicture.com/outlinerHowto.html&amp;lt;/a>	The docs are interesting, if you like outliners -- but also interesting because they illustrate something important about the outliner. It's very easy to include in a web page. 	There's a practice outliner right there on the docs page. Kind of subtle. ;-)	It's written in JavaScript. Yet it's indistinguishable from the outliners we've been using, for many years, running native on Windows and Mac. This outliner runs in any HTML-5 compatible browser, on any OS. 	You install the software by reloading the page. 	Next Monday we'll show the next bit in our queue. And the Monday after that, the next one, etc. 	Our cup runneth over!

He makes it seem like someone else is the problem. Bad evil is the kind that comes with a bull's eye on your back that says "Hit me -- please." Google does the latter kind.	&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/21/mrBurns.gif" width="95" height="236" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named mrBurns.gif">&amp;lt;/a>It would have been so easy to ease the pain of Reader withdrawal by putting some effort into creating a scapegoat. Someone to blame for the trouble users are having. "At least Google did xxx," their supporters might say. But their withdrawal has all the care and sensitivity of DuPont refusing to clean up a chemical &amp;lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/">disaster site&amp;lt;/a>. Sure it happens all the time, quietly -- but the &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;q=death+of+google+reader">death&amp;lt;/a> of Google Reader is not and could not be quiet. All the reporters and bloggers use it! And there's no one to blame but Larry and Sergey. Who end up looking like &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns">Mr Burns&amp;lt;/a> on The Simpsons. 	The fact that they're so bad at evil is encouraging. Maybe deep down inside they aren't. Maybe they truly don't see that the 1 or 2 million people, or how ever many use GR, are actual people, like members of their family, who liked Google, but now will have a hard time doing that when they associate the name with the pain of withdrawal they &amp;lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/">feel&amp;lt;/a>, from the void of news flow.Twitterquette	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/20/mirror.gif" width="125" height="181" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named mirror.gif">I've heard it said that it's impolite to talk about someone on Twitter without addressing your comment to them by using their handle, prefaced by an @. I disagree. If you're going to call someone an asshole, it's impolite to address it to them. If you're objectifying them, saying something you wouldn't say to their face -- then don't say it to their face dammit. :-)	I know because I'm sometimes on the receiving end of this. 	Oh that &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">@davewiner&amp;lt;/a>, he's such an idiot.	I would much prefer if they left the @ off it. Otherwise I have to look at that idiotic thing over and over until it scrolls off. If you think it's going to get a reply, no way. And if you think I give a shit, I don't. It's just annoying to see a bit of stupidity staying there, like a turd in a toilet that someone refuses to flush. So I usually just &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/06/whyYouGotBlocked.html">block&amp;lt;/a> em. :-)	Sometimes it &amp;lt;i>makes sense&amp;lt;/i> to say something about someone you wouldn't want them to see.	For example. The other day at lunch I was saying that Carmelo Anthony, the star of the Knicks, is never going to lead the team to a championship. I wouldn't want Anthony, a fine player, and a nice guy, to see that. I doubt if it would motivate him. And sheez it's not his fault he's in the same division as Lebron James (or for that matter occupying the same NBA as Lebron James). Even Kevin Durant, who is a great leader and player, and totally capable of being a champion, probably can't overcome the audacity and tenacity of the Miami Heat. At least not for the next few years.	So I vote for leaving off the at-sign if you're saying trash about a celeb. A toast to the Chihuahuas!	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/19/tacoBellDog.gif" width="187" height="229" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named tacoBellDog.gif">When I was a fellow at NYU, I moderated a panel on the topic of Sources Go Direct. My panelists didn't buy it. So we wandered in an unsatisfying way (to me at least) around various ideas of what media is about.	One of the speakers was &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton">Nick Denton&amp;lt;/a>, founder, publisher and ego of Gawker. Nick says that media is about gate-keeping. Your power and value is in what you let through and what you don't. He said that at the beginning of the blogging era, I had that power (me, as in Dave). He recounted a visit he and his partner made to Palo Alto, probably around 2001 or 2002 or so. They were running a startup called Moreover, and according to Nick, they wanted me to write about it on Scripting News. I didn't know. 	And I sure didn't want to be a gatekeeper! To me it's a silly idea, and antithetical to what blogging is about. I want you to say what you have to say and if I'm interested or &amp;lt;i>when&amp;lt;/i> I'm interested, I'll read it -- and not because I have to or because there's nothing else to read. We were going from the time of scarcity to overload, and that's what I wanted. Not gatekeeping. Because look who's doing the gatekeeping, some miserable person who will be dead in at most 70 years and probably a lot sooner. 	I once &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html">wrote&amp;lt;/a> about how we're all barking, farting Chihuahuas pretending our will means anything. I was thinking about the wonderful character in the Taco Bell commercials. I guess he didn't sell burritos and tacos and challupas or whatever, but I loved the dog, and now that I think of him, I miss him too. I wish they'd bring him back. I'd trade the dog for a million bankruptcy attorney ambulance-chasing mesothelioma profiteers. 		"The universe is so damned big. Billions and billions of galaxies. Every one of them filled with chihuahuas and captains of industry. None of them get out of it alive. What's it all about? Who knows? No one."		I was thinking of Bill Gates. 		&amp;lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/M8sZ1DWsAHE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	Nick is now a gatekeeper, I suppose -- and I guess he must have a soft spot for me, because anytime I want publicity from Gawker I seem to be able to get it. I wonder who he's turning down and why. 	And then I think of people I know who really are gatekeepers. And then I think of the great scene in The Godfather where all the bosses get together to tell Don Corleone to share his politicians with them. He says if you let my son come back to America you can have the politicians and judges. Now that I can get behind. An old man, in his final years, wants the comfort of his son, to drink wine with, and to tell stories to. What could be better than that! :-)Time for a Hulu-for-News?	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/19/houseOfCards.gif" width="145" height="186" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named houseOfCards.gif">On February 5, I wrote a piece called &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/restructuringNews">House of News&amp;lt;/a>, in which I suggested that the news industry might do a recalc along the lines of the one Netflix did, in deciding to give its users all the episodes of House of Cards, at once -- instead of emulating the old TV serial distribution system, the one that existed before the net.	They did something remarkable, Netflix did -- that most companies can't seem to do. They viewed the world through the eyes of their users. And decided simply to give them exactly what they wanted.	I wrote that piece before we knew that Google Reader would be shutting down in July. 	What we don't know is &amp;lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?articleid=20130319_52_E3_Google20338">why&amp;lt;/a> Google shut it down. But one possible reason is that they are trying to give the news industry what it wants, and in doing so, not only not giving the users what they want, but &amp;lt;i>willfully throwing out the work of the users,&amp;lt;/i> in building their own distribution system for news.	As hobbled as Google Reader was, it was largely a creation of its users. They did the programming for themselves. They chose what channels of news they wanted to listen to, assembling a highly customized news flow and sharing their discoveries.	If I could say one thing to the the execs of the news industry, it would be this. Stop viewing today through the lens of the past. View it from the point of view of the future. Look back to today and imagine how you could get to the future we all know is coming. And when you do that, I think you'll see that it's time for something new and Netflix-like. A news system where the users have even more power to shape the news that they will receive from you. 	It's long-past time to trust the users and just do what they want you to do. You will probably be surprised at how profitable that turns out to be. Imho of course.Dear Mr Pierce	Over the weekend Charles Pierce took a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/out-on-the-weekend-031513">swipe&amp;lt;/a> at my earlier &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/charlesPierceIsWrongAboutEzraKleinBeingWrong">piece&amp;lt;/a> about sources going direct. 	He has summarized my thoughts: "Journalism is no longer an actual profession because everyone can do it because BLOGS!, that's why. Well, fine, that's an argument. But it's not a good one."	Nor does it in any way resemble what I said. 		Or anything I have &amp;lt;i>ever&amp;lt;/i> said or thought or even dreamed.		And btw, how insulting to be called that superficial and that stupid.		This is what I mean about reporters not listening to people outside their own profession.		To Klein, he was condescending, but respectful, at least superficially. He didn't read Klein's piece either, or if he did, none of the meaning was reflected in his critique. 		My piece? Clearly he didn't even read it. And he didn't care how stupid it made &amp;lt;i>him&amp;lt;/i> look, to be so dismissive and condescending without even bothering to find out what it was he was dismissing.		Regardless, he's an entertaining and often insightful writer. But I'll always remember when reading him that I've seen some pretty sloppy thinking on his part, and it'll make me question the other stuff he says.	To Mr Pierce: I love reading your stuff, and if your getting paid is what it takes for you to continue, I hope you continue to get paid for a long time to come. I hope that puts to rest any thought that I begrudge you your salary. :-)Even more on Medium	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/16/cokeMachine.gif" width="124" height="215" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named cokeMachine.gif">A friend sent an email last week when I wrote yet another piece about Medium that I seem obsessed with it. Not really. I watch it. Not sure why. 	Why do I watch the Knicks? Certainly not because I hope they'll win. I'm just interested. Maybe I feel the same way about Medium. I'm invested in the Evan Williams story, having watched from almost the beginning, way before most other people in tech thought he was interesting. 	I remember once watching him talk on stage at a conference in Copenhagen. I had this instant visceral thought that he might be the Rupert Murdoch of this medium we were creating. I knew I wasn't that. I'm more of a creative guy, I eschew empire building. (But I do like an interesting word or phrase!)	Anyway, I was just reading this &amp;lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/03/mitt-romneys-last-hurrah.html">piece&amp;lt;/a> in the New Yorker. It's short and to the point, and asks an interesting question. Why doesn't Mitt Romney finally let his hair down a little. It's of course well-written, it's in the New Yorker after all. I thought to myself -- "I bet this is the kind of writing they're looking for at Medium."	I'm more casual a writer. I think of blogging as a written form of fresco. Made of plaster with a little coloring. It hardens fast, and you move on to something else. I used to say "we're just folks here." That's the kind of writing I aspire to. Email with Max Levchin	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/17/salute.gif" width="145" height="291" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named salute.gif">&amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bilb02/status/312336563533127681">A discussion began&amp;lt;/a> on Twitter about Google Reader between myself and &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Levchin">Max Levchin&amp;lt;/a>, and at my request moved over to email. This is the discussion so far.	Max wrote:		RSS has a decentralized pub/sub model; the format has been open and stable for a long time; the addressing scheme has no reliance on a specific client. How does the death of one, particularly good even, client, carry with it a threat to the whole ecosystem?	I responded:		They weren't just "one client" -- they dominated, in the way that MSIE dominated the browser space. And they did what MSIE did, once they gained dominance they froze development (that might have happened through competition) and stopped moving. Everything that was broken in GR became a feature of RSS. And all the things that should have happened, to mature the market, couldn't happen.		Now maybe that's about to change for the better. I hope so. But I'm not encouraged. This is a market where, in order for it to flourish, there HAS to be cooperation among vendors. That's what Twitter proved. Because they control the whole user experience they were able to solve problems that the RSS market couldn't. First, because the vendors wouldn't cooperate, and then because Google took the whole market. So we are now locked into a single vendor -- Twitter.		So the way it looks to me is that there are three possible outcomes:		1. GR's demise is also the end of RSS (which seems to me is Google's desired outcome, based on other things they did).		2. A market develops, but we're unable to get the new features into it that simplify the subscription process, so it has a chance re Twitter. 		3. A new dominant reader comes about, and if they're good then maybe something good happens.		I don't think there's the slightest possibility of #3. People in tech are just too insular, they don't study prior art, or even study their competition enough to know where the problems are, much less what the potential solutions are. 		I think more likely is a mix between #1 and #2. A continued decline for RSS as an activity and more and more reliance on big companies that don't give a fuck.Getting .mobi files into Kindle/iPad	&amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/312662420424372224">I tweeted&amp;lt;/a> that you couldn't do this, and got replies from a dozen or more people with ways to do it. And I'm happy to report at least one of them works. 	1. Use the email address that Amazon provides for your Kindle. It's on the Amazon site, poke around, you'll find it.	2. The Kindle app shows up under Apps in iTunes. You can drag .mobi files into its Documents directory and they show up in the Kindle app.	3. You can use Dropbox. It will report it can't open the files but if you look in the upper right corner of the screen there's a &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phil_b/status/312666111059578880/photo/1">way&amp;lt;/a> to send them to a bunch of apps, for .mobi files this includes the Kindle app. 	There may be other methods, if you know of them, please add a comment below.One great thing about the demise of Google Reader	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.thegreenhead.com/2008/10/lifesize-talking-wicked-witch-of-the-west-statue.php">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/15/wickedWitch.gif" width="145" height="172" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named wickedWitch.gif">&amp;lt;/a>For a long time I wouldn't create a feed that couldn't be read by Google Reader. That was after an awkward period, when Google Reader started up, that it couldn't do a good job of reading &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">Scripting News's feed&amp;lt;/a>.	Think about that for a minute. Scripting News was the &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html">first feed&amp;lt;/a>. The specs were all written in such a way that Scripting News worked. It would be impossible, unthinkable that somehow the first feed could not be read by a reader from Google. But that's the way it worked. From day one, Google came in with the attitude of The Boss Man. We run this show. I always thought well fuck that shit. What's the point of creating something new if a big asshole company can come along and break you. On day one. Not even a Hello World from a Humble Newbie. Nahh. We're Google. You're nothin.	Eventually I caved, and got rid of the features that Google couldn't handle. 	So here's the good thing -- I can put things into my feeds that Google Reader doesn't like. 	Not that I haven't already been doing that for a couple of years. ;-)Waking up to the world around you	It's always controversial to say that big tech companies make money by controlling the flows to and from users and charging others for access. But that is at least one of the businesses Silicon Valley is in. And it's definitely the business &amp;lt;i>Google&amp;lt;/i> is in, so if you want to understand why they might do something to restrict or try to control the flow of RSS, that's probably part of the story, at least. (I'm bending over backwards to be conservative here.)	The thing to fear is that Google intends to control the news people can subscribe to, the same way Apple controls what apps you can buy for the iPad. And the way Twitter decides what clients can have access to our tweets.		They've got a pretty nice interface for it, btw -- the magical Google Now. It knows what information you're likely to want to see, and shows it to you. It's really good. 			An example of how good/creepy it is. My friend Jen was coming to visit from SLC. Google Now told me her plane was 24 minutes from arriving at the gate at JFK. I had never told them what flight she was on. &amp;lt;i>I didn't know what flight she was on.&amp;lt;/i> But they did. Probably because she uses Gmail or their calendar, and somehow connected me to that trip (or did they just guess!) and thought I might be impressed if they told me about her flight. I was!		But it's creepy, in two ways. One way most people see (it's snooping on what you do to figure out what you want to see). The second way: it's also deciding what you &amp;lt;i>don't&amp;lt;/i> see. 		Centralizing this decision-making, for now, is the only way that works. But we're giving something up here. 		I love that the content of my river is not determined by any tech company. Do I think it will stay that way? It's possible that it might not. Even though I'm not running any Google software to manage it. (I run the aggregator on a Rackspace server, and the content is served from an Amazon S3 bucket.)	We broke free for a bit there with unrestricted flow from blogs and news orgs via RSS. There are people who would like to put the genie back in the bottle. They're not going to run press releases saying that. This is one of those cases where the reporters have to investigate to get the news.	News people -- if your plan for the future includes free flow of news from journalists to readers, now's the time to take a look. If you're doing a new RSS reader...	&amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/09/18/rebootingRssTwoKeyPoints.html">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/14/computerLib.gif" width="145" height="190" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named computerLib.gif">&amp;lt;/a>Since I'm working on other kinds of &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/doYouLoveOutliners">software&amp;lt;/a> right now, and the RSS world is more fluid than it's been in a long time, it seems it might be a good time to share some things I learned in the first go-around.	The main thing we &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/09/18/rebootingRssTwoKeyPoints.html">learned&amp;lt;/a> is that subscription needs to be centralized to make the process as simple as possible for the user. That's one of the main reasons Twitter was such an effective competitor. The central server keeps an OPML file for each user. Each site with a feed links to that site with the URL of its feed as a parameter. When the user clicks a Subscribe link, a dialog appears confirming that you want to subscribe. If you say OK that's it, nothing more to do. The user never sees a URL. No browser has to cooperate (not that they would). 	OPML should be a file type you can subscribe to. That makes it possible for the user to connect their account on the central subscription server to your aggregator. Also, this feature opens the possibility of a sort of super-curator, someone who manages a collections of feeds that people can subscribe to in a unit. 	Also in the argument betw mailbox and river type readers, why not do both? The same data can be viewed either way. Some times you may just have a few minutes to quickly skim the news, and other times you may be able to read feeds individually at a slower pace. I did something like this in the LBBS software in the early 80s. There was a river, and a hierarchic view. You could switch instantly between the two views, and stay on the same item. The same approach would work well for RSS (though I've never seen it done, if I were doing a new reader, I'd definitely give it a try).	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/14/rss.gif" width="65" height="59" border="0" style="float: left; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named rss.gif">Also a feed should have a way to tell readers "I'm done" -- no more updates, stop reading me. That would make it possible to do more things with RSS. I don't want to subscribe to a special feed about a specific event, knowing I'll have to remember to unsub. Better to let the feed tell the reader. This feature is documented in my &amp;lt;a href="http://microblog.reallysimple.org/">microblog namespace&amp;lt;/a> and it's supported in my &amp;lt;a href="http://docs.reallysimple.org/">Radio2&amp;lt;/a> linkblogging tool.	There are lots of other ideas like this. I'll write them up as I remember them. Do you love outliners?	&amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/smallpict">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/14/lisa.gif" width="125" height="189" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named lisa.gif">&amp;lt;/a>I first started using an outliner in the late 1970s, on Unix. It was character-based, on a scrolling display. You'd type commands like &amp;lt;code>1,$p&amp;lt;/code> to show all the lines at the current level. You could view the subs of any headline, by typing the number next to it, and pressing Return. The basic operations were "dive" and "surface." Moving things around was a little more difficult, but it was the best you could do with the computers of the day. 	The tools advanced through the years. Influenced by Visicalc, then Lotus 1-2-3. That's when the outliner got a "bar cursor" which points to a structure, much like Visicalc's cursor points to a spreadsheet cell. You moved the cursor around with the arrow keys, and expanded by pressing &amp;lt; and collapsed by pressing >. These keys were chosen as mnemonics, they looked symbolically like the operations they were performing. 	Pretty soon after that we got the mouse, so you could double-click to expand and collapse and also drag things from one place to another. This made stuff flow better. That's a key idea -- outlines are about flow, they make text fluid (i.e. able to flow).	Then came graphics, and with that bullet charts and tree charts. All of a sudden there was a production application for outliners, they could be made to do things more efficiently on a computer than could be done with ink, paper and scissors. The business exploded. 	All along, I have been writing code and prose with the outliner. These days I use it to narrate my work and to coordinate with the people I work with. It's an amazingly flexible swiss-army-knife-like super-adaptable tool. 	I've been doing a lot more with outliners in the last few months, in a project I've been working on with a new programming partner, Kyle Shank, at a new company we founded late last year, &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/">Small Picture&amp;lt;/a>. It has both a server side and a client side. Next week we will show the first bits of the client software. I think it will surprise people what it can do and how it does it. But this wouldn't be a good tease if I told you more about what it is. :-)	In the meantime, if you have stories to tell about how you love outlining, please consider posting them. I love outliners, but I love outliner &amp;lt;i>users&amp;lt;/i> even more. They're such bright people and so incredibly powerful and creative. Software that enables powerful people. 	So much more to say and I hope to say it all.Google Reader's demise, part 2	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/14/hope.gif" width="150" height="253" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named hope.gif">Last night we &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/goodbyeGoogleReader">said goodbye&amp;lt;/a> to Google Reader, and that got a lot of traffic and a fair amount of hate, from people who love Google Reader and probably don't like to hear from someone who uses RSS who won't miss it (i.e. me). 	I wanted to say that it's possible to use RSS without being dependent on Google Reader. And since GR is going away, that should probably be seen as &amp;lt;i>good news,&amp;lt;/i> not bad. 	But it's not my problem. I'm not in the RSS Reader business any longer, and have no interest in returning to it. 	I don't doubt that people will be well-served by a newly revitalized market for RSS products, now that the dominant product, the 800-pound gorilla, is withdrawing. Goodbye Google Reader	I won't miss it. Never used the damn thing. Didn't trust the idea of a big company like Google's interests being so aligned with mine that I could trust them to get  all my news. 	And besides, I didn't think the mailbox approach to news was right. Who cares how many unread items there are. I like the river of news approach and I have a very fine set of rivers that keep me well supplied with news and podcasts. Have a look.	&amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave">http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave&amp;lt;/a>	July 1 isn't that far away, but there's time to get it together. Next time, please pay a fair price for the services you depend on. Those  have a better chance of surviving the bubbles. 	PS: This message attracted comments some pretty sick comments, so I deleted the whole thread. Charles Pierce is wrong about Ezra Klein being wrong	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/12/hope.gif" width="150" height="253" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named hope.gif">I'm a big fan of both Pierce and Klein. I love Pierce's irreverent writing style, and his political opinions match up pretty well with mine. I learn stuff by reading his columns in Esquire. Same with Klein. He's intelligent, and asks good questions, and backs up his thinking with information. It's sad that his way of working is so rare among political analysts these days. 	But guys like Pierce (who criticizes Klein in his &amp;lt;a href="http://www.readability.com/articles/icoynoiu">recent piece&amp;lt;/a>, more about that in a minute) only read other news people. The chances of either of them reading what I write are pretty close to nil, so the chances of them passing along a good idea that I might have are therefore also nil. This is embarassing, because the epiphany of Klein's that Pierce mocks happens to be one that I have been writing about for almost 20 years, over and over. Think of all the time everyone could have saved if they deigned to pay attention to people who don't do what they do. It's tragic that it took a smart guy like Klein so long to understand such a basic structural truth about how news, his own profession, has been working &amp;lt;i>for the last 15 years.&amp;lt;/i> Gives you some idea about the power of the blinders this community puts on.		&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair">Upton Sinclair&amp;lt;/a>: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."	Now, in the past, any idea that didn't penetrate the haze of guys like Klein and Pierce would have very little chance of being heard by people like myself who might be interested. However, because we live in the times of the Internet and what Klein calls The &amp;lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/10/revenge-of-the-sources/">Revenge of the Sources&amp;lt;/a>, I can go ahead and be heard without them listening. I call this &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/05/15/sourcesGoDirect.html">Sources Go Direct&amp;lt;/a>, which means the same thing, but in a more positive less journalist-centered view. It's not revenge, it's more pragmatic. The old system didn't work. So we use the new one instead.	If you look at the mechanics of how a news story is created and flows, there are sources, a reporter, an editor or two, a production and design group, a printing press or web site, a delivery system and finally readers. In the past I have been a source, and I still am, because reporters can and sometimes do quote my blog. I wish they would do it more. I am also an avid reader. I am not, and never have been, and don't want to be, a reporter or an editor or any of the other things. I do write publishing systems, and have created some of the software that these guys probably use. 	Pierce incorrectly thinks that every act of journalism is done by reporters. Look at the list of people in the paragraph above. There are lots of other roles. The sources aren't covering a fatal crash on Sunday night on Route 128 (his example). Instead they're writing, on their blogs, about the things they know about. Perhaps they were involved in the crash. Perhaps they witnessed it. 	In software, lots of stuff gets created that isn't on the radar of people like Pierce or Klein. They have very limited focus. They look to big rich companies with lots of employees for technology innovation. Makes sense, because they're employees of big rich companies. Of course that's what they understand. But if you look at the history of software (and very few people do) you'll notice that the big ideas almost never come from those places. If you understand the process of software, you'd understand why that's so. 	So while I admire both Klein and Pierce for their work as news people, boy would it be great if they looked outside their close-knit little community. Klein is a pioneer in his field for noticing Sources Go Direct first among his peers. But the idea was available to him long ago. And Pierce, a very flexible thinker when it comes to politics, has no flexibility in thinking about media, no ability to see things from other peoples' point of view, as demonstrated by his piece about Klein. And that's so important, and has been important for a very long time.	I've met Pierce's attitude many times, from all kinds of ink-stained pros, some very accomplished. The arrogance is impressive, but they're still wrong. I don't care how many Pulitzers you have. The news process has been reorganizing for quite some time. You may not choose to see it, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening. 	PS: Do I think either of them will read this piece? Nah. :-)What comes after Facebook?	It's pretty obvious what comes next, via extrapolation -- from past turns of the wheel in software.	What comes next is an easy way for the generation of people who grew up on Facebook to create their own social networks, accessible only by the people they want to share it with. 	A somewhat easier to use version of what AWS is today will be the platform. 	And Harvard dropouts of the day will create AMIs their friends will configure cleverly.	The art in this new way of doing things will be clever twists on "share."A business model for movie theaters	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/09/heavenWaitBig.gif">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/09/hcw.gif" width="125" height="192" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named hcw.gif">&amp;lt;/a>I'd like to have a film festival for my friends. 	So I'll give you a list of 20 movies, Mr Movie Theater Owner, and one night every other week, you'll play one of them, and I'll guarantee a certain number of tickets sold. Above that, we'll split the revenue. 	That way we get to watch old movies in a theater setting, with popcorn and restrooms, and then we can all go out to dinner after and talk about the movies and why we like them so much. Maybe we could even get one of the actors or the director to join us. 	Movie theaters should be hubs for social activity. Watching a movie at home or on a laptop or a tablet isn't the same as watching it in a theater. And most of the great movies  aren't showing in theaters now.Medium shows more	I watched the Evan Williams &amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBDPO8b-NUg">interview&amp;lt;/a> with Jason Calacanis at the &amp;lt;a href="http://festival.launch.co/">Launchfest&amp;lt;/a> conference in SF, and that gave me a better idea of what he's thinking about with his new company, Medium. The next day we learned that &amp;lt;a href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/03/07/ex-wired-editor-evan-hansen-lands-at-obvious-corp-will-lead-editorial-for-medium/">Evan Hansen&amp;lt;/a> is now working for Medium. Evan was the longtime editor of wired.com. Highly respected guy. 	What is Medium doing? My guess -- if you were to draw a line and at one end put blogging tools and at the other put BuzzFeed, SB Nation and Huffington, that Medium is on that line, and closer to the right than the left.		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/08/diagram.gif" width="500" height="111" border="0" alt="A picture named diagram.gif">	Medium's strength appears to be the elegance and HTML 5-ness of its editorial tools. It feels nice using their editor. Like the content networks, being able to create content there is invite-only. But I'm assuming at some point it will be open to everyone, the way Tumblr or WordPress are. 	An advantage Medium is likely to have is a connection to Twitter, which doesn't have a blogging system, and has recently had success with Vine. Twitter giving Medium a boost is good business, for the owners of both companies. ;-)	I'm very interested in where all  this is going, keeping an ear out and listening. What I learned from jury duty	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/08/trex.gif" width="100" height="110" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named trex.gif">I got called for jury duty this week, Wednesday and Thursday. In NYC, you go for two days, and sit and wait for a trial. Then they herd 75 citizens of New York County into a courtroom and winnow us until there are 14 left -- 12 jurors and two alternates, and the rest go back into the pool. If you make it through two days without being selected, you go home and resume your life. Otherwise you're a juror. But the education process begins the minute you sit down in the waiting room. 	This time I made it as far as a courtroom, but I wasn't chosen as one of the initial group of 24 to be interviewed, but I was required to stay, to wait for the selection to be final. I got to relax while watching my fellow citizens go through the process, where each of the sides, prosecution first, then defense, asks questions to see if you'd be a good juror. 	It was an eye-opener. The judge had explained a few of important points: 1. The defendent, accused of burglary, is innocent until proven guilty. 2. The standard of proof is high. You had to be certain the person had done what he was accused of, beyond a reasonable doubt. Otherwise -- innocent. 3. The burden of proof is on the state. The defendent can remain silent, and you can't use that fact in coming up with a decision. 	Some jurors didn't seem to understand any of this. They would agree with all ideas when the judge explained it, but when asked a question: "If you think there's a decent chance the person committed the crime, what would your verdict be?" Many of them said  something like this: "Well, it would depend on the evidence." You could see the frustration with the lawyers in the room. It's as if you were teaching someone how to enter a command on a computer. "First you type some characters then you press the Return key." They would say they understand, but still not be able to enter a command. 	What would you think if the accused did not speak in his own defense, would that make you think he's guilty? Yes, some said. 	In the end they had to go with jurors who were pretty hazy on the decision-making process, what the rights of the accused are, and how jurors are supposed to think about the crime and the evidence and testimony. I was reminded that it was like this on the jury I served on. Some people just didn't get that there were rules to innocence and guilt. That it isn't like a family, where you live in a fog of who-did-what-to-whom-when, that in the end we will make a decision, and based on that, this person will go free, or go to jail. 	Jury duty is all about teaching us what it means to be a juror. There's a lot to learn, and the education system or television or our parents, or whatever, didn't do a very good job.HTML 5 localStorage demo	One of the neatest features in HTML 5 is &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/usersGuideToLocalStorage">localStorage&amp;lt;/a>. 	It lets an app store as much as 5MB of data on the local machine. 	I wanted to understand how it works so I wrote a demo.	&amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/misc/localStorageDemo.html">http://scripting.com/misc/localStorageDemo.html&amp;lt;/a>	View source if you want to see how it works.	Hope you find it useful. :-)My first github repo	I've been working almost exclusively in &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript&amp;lt;/a> for the last few months.	It's been a very uplifting and interesting experience. HTML 5 running in the browser with JS is an incredible platform, with lots of unexplored potential, and very few limits. I haven't been this excited about a platform in a long time. And have been having a blast programming it. 	A lot of new stuff will be showing up in the coming months. Along the way you're probably going to think I'm teasing, and you'll be right, but there's no way to release as much stuff as we are going to, without doing it in stages, learning as we go, and letting that influence the next steps. 	Anyway, here's a beginning. 	&amp;lt;a href="https://github.com/scripting/utils.js">https://github.com/scripting/utils.js&amp;lt;/a>	It's a small number of date and string functions in JS patterned after &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/beginning/whatFrontierIs.html">Frontier&amp;lt;/a> verbs. Have you met your users?	Last summer I went back to Madison, and part of the trip was a tour of the Computer Science &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=computer+science+building+madison+wi+dayton&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=computer+science+building+madison+wi+dayton&amp;cid=0,0,416637037957643769&amp;t=m&amp;z=16">building&amp;lt;/a>, where I had been a graduate student many years ago. The building had changed in many ways, and in others, not at all.	1. The outside was exactly the same. 	2. The mainframes were gone, replaced by labs of personal computers.	3. The basement was divided up in a totally different way than it was before. The two rooms I spent most of my time in were gone. 	4. And most important, the most exciting idea -- there's now a computer store in the front of the building. 	I was excited because I assumed that this meant that computer science students were actually meeting users, and learning how they think. But no, they staff the store with employees, just like any other store. My guide looked at me with what I imagined was puzzlement. Why would they want their students to work with users.	Me, I'm always thinking about users, what I can and can't get them to do. What I can get away with, and how can I make them tell other people about my software, and even better, get them to get others to use it. ;-)	There are frustrations, both ways. But if you see software development as a performing art, as I do, inevitably you're going to be judged by them. They will determine your success or failure. 	And over the years, I've found this is the hardest point to make to the developers I work with.Why Windows lost to Mac	First, understand that this is a blog post, a highly prejudiced thing, completely determined by one self-important person's experiences. 	I'm a hypocrite too. :-)	Anyway, I lived through this. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/04/whiteMacLaptop.gif">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/04/smallLaptop.gif" width="145" height="103" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named smallLaptop.gif">&amp;lt;/a>I was a Windows user in 2005, when I had to get a Mac because I was supporting people who used my OPML Editor app on the Mac, as well as Windows. It didn't seem right that I couldn't see what the updates looked like on the Mac, even if it was open source software, and not generating any money for me. So I bought a $1000 white plastic &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/04/whiteMacLaptop.gif">laptop&amp;lt;/a> in the Apple &amp;lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/retail/yorkdale/">store&amp;lt;/a> in Toronto. It was the first time I had been in an Apple store. 	It's a long story why I was so uninterested in using Apple products at the time. I had been an early Mac developer, shipping a product in 1984, and continuing to develop through the mid-90s. But when my product, Frontier, became available on Windows in 1998, I switched to Windows. Windows machines performed much better than the Macs of the day, and Apple had a new strategy every four months. I was very happy to get onto the safe ground that Windows offered.	Back to 2005, the first thing I noticed about the white Mac laptop, that aside from being a really nice computer, there was no malware. In 2005, Windows was a horror. Once a virus got on your machine, that was pretty much it. And Microsoft wasn't doing much to stop the infestation. For a long time they didn't even see it as their problem. In retrospect, it was the computer equivalent of Three Mile Island or Chernobyl.	Anyway, that's why when I read &amp;lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/03/open_and_shut">Gruber's&amp;lt;/a> and &amp;lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/03/there-was-that-whole-internet-thing-too/">Arrington's&amp;lt;/a> discussion about why the Mac won, I was once again amazed about what a fog we all live in, and how little grasp there is of other people's experiences. I don't doubt that for these guys malware didn't make a big difference. Maybe &amp;lt;i>I&amp;lt;/i> was the outlier, maybe not many other people thought it would be nice to take a vacation from fighting the viruses. And then the vaction became permanent. (As it did for me. I dabbled in PCs after getting the white laptop. But I bought basically every bit of hardware Apple has offered since then. And I made most of my friends do so too.)	We don't do well at sharing experiences on the net about these subjects. The flamers pretty much control discourse, or have in the past. I think that's one reason our grasp of history is so hazy. A lot like the great movie, &amp;lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Fog-War-Lessons-McNamara/dp/B0001L3LUE">Fog of War&amp;lt;/a>. See it if you want to understand more about the tech industry. 		&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MHdMeHxDg90" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>&lt;/pre>May 2012 = &lt;pre>Bitly's "bitmarks"	Sound a bit like &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/05/20/whatIsABlorkmark.html">blorkmarks&amp;lt;/a>. Heh. Well not quite as cool. Anyway, it looks like they're &amp;lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/29/3050473/bitly-social-redesign-iphone-app">creeping up&amp;lt;/a> on Twitter. Sharing bookmarks with your friends is a lot like what people use Twitter for, wouldn't you say? Maybe Twitter is finally getting some competition. Should Google have posting API?	Blogging tools have had posting APIs since the beginning of the art, starting back in the mid--late-90s. Blogger, WordPress, Tumblr, they all have them. As does Twitter. It doesn't seem to have hurt them. Yet Google-Plus doesn't have a posting API. If it did, I would publish my &amp;lt;a href="http://links.scripting.com/">stream&amp;lt;/a> there, and they would have some good sticky content that they don't now have. I think they should do it.Will Twitter ever have competition?	There was the beginning of a lively debate at my talk at &amp;lt;a href="http://meshconference.com/">Mesh&amp;lt;/a> earlier this week in Toronto. I say if Twitter ever gets competition, or thinks competition might be coming soon, they will buy a news organization, maybe several. But it hinges on this question. Can there be another Twitter? What if a service did everything Twitter did but had a 280-character limit. Just enough to be interesting, but not enough (maybe) to blow away the mode of use of Twitter. Would you try it? Do you think it would be useful?$50 for a year of the NYT?	I keep getting emails from the NYT with offers for a digital subscription. They say I can get it really cheap for a certain number of weeks. Then what? Well, I thought, what if I made &amp;lt;i>them&amp;lt;/i> an offer. I thought of &amp;lt;a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls&amp;lt;/a>. This is what he advocates. Let users make offers to vendors. So I gave it some thought and came up with $50 a year to be able to access as much of the Times site as I want, no paywall. $50 they're not getting now. Money on the table. Act now! Or make a counter, which I would consider. I don't want any limited-time offers. Give me an offer for a year, or don't make a counter at all. Dead is dead.	Discuss.If I were Google	I'd fight Facebook with RSS. Re-integrate RSS with Chrome. Make subscription something browsers support. Provide an open, clonable, simple web service that returns a subscription list for any user (with permission of course) so a million ideas for RSS aggregators can bloom.

Amateurs don't have relationships with the vendors to protect. 	2. The reviews don't all come the week before the product is announced. 	3. They aren't rehashes of press releases. 	4. They reflect actual experience using the product, over a period of weeks instead of minutes, in the case of some professional reviews. What are threads for?	They're bigger than tweets, not 140-char constrained, and express simple ideas that can be understood in a second or two. They inspire informational responses. The responses are stored &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/16/corporateBloggingSilos.html">elsewhere&amp;lt;/a>, and that's a problem, but the source is on my server. Chrome is better	I've spend a couple of days working fulltime in Chrome, and it's improved my workflow. 	Firefox disappears sometimes, I sit there waiting for my computer to come back. Doesn't seem to happen with Chrome even though I accumulate a ton of tabs, as with Firefox. 	I've launched Firefox a few times to access Firebug. I haven't figured out how to get Chrome's builtin debugger to open in a separate window. Once I have that, I probably won't need to go to Firefox.JPM's $2 billion loss? I don't get it	I've heard or read a half dozen reports on the $2 billion loss at JPMorgan, but don't understand why this is such a big deal. To a bank the size of JPM, $2 billion isn't very much money. If a company like GM or Microsoft lost $2 billion on a product, they'd shrug it off and go on. Probably happens all the time.

Title. 2. Byline (author, when it was posted). 3. Prev/next. 4. Body. 5. Disqus comment block. 	There will be a menu at the top of the page, like the menu at the top of this page, but that's not part of the page design, it's more a component of the site.	Clarity is key.

So far no luck.I can see Clyde shaking his head	I watched the first game of the Knicks playoff series with the Heat on TNT. I didn't know that MSG was also broadcasting them. That is of course where I watched Game 2, last night.	I totally missed &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier">Walt Frazier's&amp;lt;/a> narration of the first game. Because he played the game himself, and was one of the coolest most zen-like competitors ever. When players get upset about a call, Clyde (what every calls Frazier) says this is not good. Teams that are focusing on the past, a bad call, aren't in the present game. They lose their fluidity. They're grunting and groaning. If the other guys are dishing and swishing, they win. Sometimes both teams lose the plot, that's pretty interesting too.	There's a lot more to basketball than most announcers get to. But when you watch every Knicks game, you always want to know what Clyde has to say. And I'm sure he's not liking what he's &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Amareisreal/status/197219314573647872">seeing&amp;lt;/a>. &lt;/pre>May 2013 = &lt;pre>Dropbox is down	We love that we don't have to run servers for most of what &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a> does, but that means we rely on Dropbox's and Amazon's servers.	And Dropbox appears to be down now, and that means no Fargo.	I feel the same sense of abandonment and confusion that other Fargo users feel.	Nothing to be done about it until Dropbox comes back.	Update at 11:30AM Eastern -- Dropbox is back up. :-)	DaveMy first ride on a CitiBike	I just got back from a ride on a CitiBike, one of NYC's new bikeshare deals.	Executive summary: It works. I felt like I was there on the first day the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway#History">subway&amp;lt;/a> opened in NYC. 	However it was not without glitches. 	I am a founding member, having paid the $95 annual fee on the first day they were available. I am user number 1411. In theory as long as each trip is 45 minutes or less, I don't have to pay any more money to use bikes. As much as I want. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/photos/archive/2013/05/26/imGoingToRideOneOfTheseBikesTom/original.jpg">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/27/bikes.gif" width="125" height="167" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 40px; padding-bottom: 25px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named bikes.gif">&amp;lt;/a>But how does it work? I looked all over the &amp;lt;a href="https://citibikenyc.com/faq">website&amp;lt;/a>. They had instructions for people who were buying day passes or week passes, but no instructions for people who have annual memberships. I figured I'd find out when I got to the bike station. 	I went to the &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/photos/archive/2013/05/17/citibikeStationNearPark/original.jpg">kiosk&amp;lt;/a>. No instructions for members. They did however suggest you get a membership if you're going to use it a lot. Okay I got one, so what do I do? No clue. 	I wasn't going to go home without trying it so I put my credit card in and started the process of buying a daily pass. There are some real usability problems with this system. First, it's very slow. Second, the display is at about belt level for me. Granted I'm tall, but not &amp;lt;i>that&amp;lt;/i> tall. Some of the instructions refer to buttons that aren't there. You might guess wrong, as I did. Some user testing could have avoided this.	It was so slow at responding to keystrokes, about midway through the process (I guess) after asking for my phone number and zip code, it just gave up and took me back to the main menu. By then a small crowd had gathered around to find out how it worked. A guy who had done it before showed me that I didn't need to do any of this. There's an unmarked slot where you can insert your keychain card. I did. It took a while for the light to turn from red to green. When it did, I was able to take the bike out of the rack, I adjusted the seat and off I went, south on Broadway toward Times Square.  	The bike looks like a klunker, but it rides pretty smooth!	It has three gears, probably not enough, but pretty close to enough.	It's comfortable, more comfortable than my &amp;lt;a href="http://bike.davewiner.com/">regular ride&amp;lt;/a>.	There are flashing red lights on the rear of the bike. (I know this because I saw them on another CitiBike.)	There's no bell. That makes it an &amp;lt;a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2012/06/01/nypd-bike-equipment-checkpoint-snares-cyclists-for-missing-bells/">illegal bike&amp;lt;/a> in NYC, as I understand it. There were many times on my little excursion that I wish I had a bell. Pedestrians in NYC think bike lanes are useful for picnics, baby carriages (with babies in them), hand-holding at arms length. Waiting for red lights. You name it. The cars like to honk when they think you're in their way. It'd be nice to have something to fight back with, even though a bell sounds a little wimpy, it's less likely to get you killed than the typical NYers salute of &amp;lt;i>Fuck You Asshole.&amp;lt;/i> :-)		Update: &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dfinke/status/339129229524471809">Apparently&amp;lt;/a> it &amp;lt;i>has&amp;lt;/i> a bell, I just didn't spot it. 	As soon as I entered Times Square proper, I took a right and headed over to Ninth Ave and rode all the way downtown to Bleecker St, where I made a left on 4th St, and dropped the bike off at the stand on 7th Ave. I got a couple of hot dogs at the Papaya Dog on 8th St, and rode the 1 train back uptown.	It was on the subway that I realized that I had just used a new form of city transport, one that's perfectly suited for NY. I encountered a few other riders on my way. There's a Zero Day kind of feel to it. People seem excited. The bikes are nice. And there are enough bike lanes to get around. 	Bloomberg is a total 1 percenter, and a real dick about some things, but he got this one right. He will be remembered as a visionary mayor. I believe this is a keeper. Bikes and NY go together. New Flickr	Users like changes in products that are responsive to their needs and wants. 	Bugs fixed. Performance improved. A key missing feature added. 	Users like a dialog with the product creators that show there's an understanding. That seems to work best if the people who decide about the product are also users of the product. 		Star Trek fans were horrified to find out that JJ Abrams was not a Star Trek fan. 		Couldn't they find a show runner who &amp;lt;i>liked&amp;lt;/i> Star Trek-style science fiction? 	That's why we watch serial shows like Mad Men. We like to see the characters we've come to know in new situations. We nod our heads, that's right, that's what Don Draper would do. If all of a sudden Don Draper started acting like Instagram, we'd wonder if we had the wrong channel. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/27/newCoke.gif" width="125" height="215" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named newCoke.gif">I've been using Flickr since almost the beginning. When I started, a generous Scripting News reader gifted me with a Pro account, and I've been paying the $25 every year. Sometimes I ask myself if I reallly want to do it, but in the end I always pay the money.	All the while, Flickr hardly changed at all. I wasn't sure if this was a good thing. It meant that the management at Yahoo wasn't paying  attention, I figured. At least if they aren't paying attention there's little chance they'd screw with it. For many years they stayed away. But last week all that changed. All of it. 	The change in Flickr was radical. And the performance of the site, which recently has been pretty bad, got worse. I assume this is because the servers have to do a lot more work to figure out how to lay out the photos so they show up in a neat array, as if we were reading a magazine instead of browsing a website. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.infinitehollywood.com/the-new-flickr-sucks-and-heres-why/">Other people&amp;lt;/a> have analyzed the deal changes, I honestly don't care much if it's $25 or $50, and I don't come close to using a terabyte. Mostly what I value from Flickr is the longevity of it. It seemed like a safe place to leave my pictures. My father's pictures are there too. He died in 2009. Up till now I wasn't too worried. 	Couldn't Flickr have given us the option of not using the new features? What if we don't want them? Why force this on us. 	What if I don't like the idea of ads on my pictures, the ones I pay them to store for me, btw. I can pay to get rid of the ads for myself, but as I understand it (and my understanding might be wrong) the ads will still show up for people who view my pictures.	I want my pictures to be the star on Flickr, not Flickr. I don't care if they're hip -- or if they appeal to people who like Instagram or Facebook or whatever. I kind of doubt whether the superficial changes they make will attract many new users. Their competition have been out there for quite some time. I don't think Flickr did anyting more than match them. And the changes are so superficial. It looks like a mask that says Instagram while lurking in the back is something old and ugly, as if they're embarassed about what Flickr was. The site I thought was good enough to pay $25 a year to use. Flickr which looked just fine without the mask, now looks like a New Yorker cartoon. A parody of something that was pretty good as it was, and is horribly tragically pathetic trying to be something it's not and probably never will be.	I don't know what the answer is. Yahoo had a lot of money and offered some to the founders of Flickr. I don't blame them one bit for taking it. And how could the management at Yahoo understand what they bought if they weren't themselves users? 	There's a lot of irony in the fact that all this embarassing change was implemented on the same day they were promisng that they would never do to Tumblr what they were proudly and openly doing to Flickr. Didn't anyone at Yahoo speak up and say that maybe people might notice the disconnect?Fargo thread on Hacker News	I didn't want to post Fargo to Hacker News because it would seem too much like an ad, but this evening someone else did, and it's generating a lot of new users, and people seem genuinely excited about it.	&amp;lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5772623">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5772623&amp;lt;/a>	It's worth having a look at, and if you think it's interesting, please upvote! :-)	Thanks! Kickstarter for VCs	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/26/planetMoneySquirrel.gif" width="160" height="145" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named planetMoneySquirrel.gif">Listening to the latest Planet Money gave me an idea. They went to &amp;lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/planetmoney/planet-money-t-shirt">Kickstarter&amp;lt;/a> to give their fans a way to fund public radio in a fun way, by buying a t-shirt. They used this event as a way to program a few shows where they examined the economics of t-shirts, and since it's Planet Money it was &amp;lt;i>hugely&amp;lt;/i> interesting. I love their show. And they raised an astounding amount of money. $590,807.		&amp;lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="380" src="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/planetmoney/planet-money-t-shirt/widget/card.html" width="220">&amp;lt;/iframe>	I thought that the way they did it might work for raising money from tech investors and successful entrepreneurs to fund the development of new open formats and protocols. 	My work generates open formats and protocols, because unlike most other entrepreneurs, I have a philosophy of no lock-in for users. This makes me more vulnerable to predatory competition, and it usually it comes from VC-backed companies. It's hard for me to compete with them not only because they have more money (lots) but they also have the halo that comes from VC investment. There was a time when money from Kleiner Perkins was a huge lift for a startup and they're still a powerful ally, but now Union Square and Spark Capital are even more influential.	I've talked with the principal guys at these funds about changing the way they invest. Let's add a premium to investments that add to the open ecosystem instead of just consuming, but so far none of them have been willing to go for it. So it falls to me to do it for them. I'm not aware of other companies that do this, if there are any please send me an email. 	I think it's a good idea for investors to put back, so that when this cycle winds down, as it inevitably will, there are some new open formats and protocols to build on. If you depend on me to do it, the results won't be as good as they should be. 	Now, we could go to Kickstarter and ask end-users to fund development of open formats and protocols, and it might work -- it did for the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mbs348/diaspora-the-personally-controlled-do-it-all-distr">Diaspora&amp;lt;/a> guys. But I suspect they were more investing in their anti-Facebook message, or their youthfu optimism (some might say naivete). I won't make my work anti-anything (except lock-in which isn't a thing really, it's more of a practice) and as you know I lost my peach fuzz a long time ago. ;-)	I think successful VCs and entrepreneurs should invest. I think they should kick back into the ecosystem that made them rich. I'll recuse myself from any investments such a Kickstarter might make, in fact I'll put money in along-side them. Let's give all new companies an incentive to give freedom of choice to their users, right from the start. 	Look at it this way -- when you get good service at a restaurant, you don't have to leave a tip. But you do anyway, because it's the right thing to do. Same thing here. Open formats make people rich. Those people should give back to create more open formats for themselves the next group of investors, entrepreneurs and users. If you love to make software...	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/myReallySimple/2013/05/26/davecast2013may26.m4a">A 14-min podcast&amp;lt;/a> about programming as art and engineering, and why if that's what you do, you keep doing it. Mathew taught me something	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/25/accordionGuy.gif" width="172" height="259" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named accordionGuy.gif">In late March when we shipped &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&amp;lt;/a>, Mathew Ingram wrote a very &amp;lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/28/watch-out-internet-dave-winer-is-back-in-the-business-of-making-blogging-tools/">nice piece&amp;lt;/a> about our startup in GigaOm. But the title was problematic. It said: "Watch out, internet: Dave Winer is back in the business of making blogging tools." I groaned. We had just shipped an &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner">outliner&amp;lt;/a>, a small one, and there were no blogging tools anywhere in sight. But somehow, looking at my outliner, Mathew saw blogging. I should have listened more carefully. Instead I wrote a &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/imNotMakingBloggingTools">post&amp;lt;/a> that claimed, boldly: "I'm not making blogging tools." I put a smiley after it to show there were no hard feelings. I wanted to get on the record quickly and clearly. Don't think this is a blogging tool. It's an outliner. 	Then in April we &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/fargoPress.html">shipped&amp;lt;/a> a much more ambitious product, &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a> -- whose name relative to Little Outliner was supposed to be kind of a pun. Little Outliner is little, but Fargo will Go Far(ther). How far it will go has not yet been revealed, but we're hard at work on a publishing platform that Fargo connects to. At the time I didn't think that the publishing side could or should be viewed as blogging. But now, as it's evolved, and I've met our first users (back in March we didn't know who they were), I can see that Mathew was right. We &amp;lt;i>are&amp;lt;/i> in the business of making blogging tools. Did I know it at the time when I said we weren't? I didn't. Nothing changed except the product and the users. If they are changing, you have to go with them. You can't fight City Hall, and if your users say it's blogging, and a respected analyst says it's blogging -- it's blogging. ;-)	Another thing happened while all our development was going on -- Tumblr, a product which I have deep respect for, sold to Yahoo. What I admire most about Tumblr, as a product designer, is its templating system. It's a descendent of the ones we developed at UserLand in Manila and Radio, which in turn were descended from the templates used by designers in the desktop publishing era using Quark and Pagemaker. 	Templating is at the core of blogging. The reach of a blogging system is determined by the richness and flexibility of its templating. And here's an interesting fact. If the content has structure, as outlines do, you can do a lot more for the user with templates. CSS is a nice beginning, but the outlines give you power flat text designers and authors can only dream of. 	We can, and are, doing more. Tumblr has now been around for a long time. Our earlier work has been around even longer. It's time for a fresh look at tools for designers, writers and programmers, centered around web content. If people want to think of that as &amp;lt;i>blogging,&amp;lt;/i> who am I to argue with them.	So I won't. :-)	PS: A good content tool should also be a workgroup collaboration tool, as &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/fargoWorkgroup.html">Fargo is&amp;lt;/a>. Investing in America on Memorial Day	There's a false argument about the national debt that goes like this.	We can't leave a huge debt for future generations to pay off. 	It's false for a couple of reasons:		1. If you make good investments, they create growth and the growth pays off the investment. That's how business works. If you build an interstate highway system, that creates growth in cities that weren't served well by other forms of transport, they pay more taxes, and those taxes are used to pay back the bonds that were sold to create the highways. 			The time to worry is when we make investments that don't create value, like the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. No growth came as a result of that borrowing. We should think very carefully before starting unnecessary wars, aside from the moral reasons, the economics are really tough.		2. We pay the debt back in a currency that we print. So if there isn't enough money coming in from #1, we pay back the bond holders with new dollars. You say that's inflationary, and I'm no economist, but I have a bit of common sense. If taxes aren't generating enough to pay back your good investments that's because the economy is depressed, and in those times a little inflation is a &amp;lt;i>good&amp;lt;/i> thing, because it counteracts something even worse than inflation -- deflation.	But even if you don't buy the math of it, consider the emotional argument. You're worried about future generations, but what about our debt to &amp;lt;i>past generations&amp;lt;/i> that sacrificed for us so we could have good education, homes, health care, transport? Aren't we betraying them if we let the infrastructure they built for us crumble and disappear? 	When do we think about our ancestors and what we owe &amp;lt;i>them?&amp;lt;/i> 	Of course that's what Memorial Day is for. To remember the people who came before, especially those who sacrificed so we could be propserous and healthy. We invest in our country because the only other option is to see the country crumble. And we invest because we hope for a &amp;lt;i>better&amp;lt;/i> future for those who come next. The whitewashing method	You know how they have all these methods of development, agile, etc.	My method is whitewashing fences.	I'm Tom Sawyer and I have a great fence and some paint.	It's a beautiful day and I'm having the time of my life whitewashing this fence.	My friends want to know if they can do it too.	I don't know! I'm having so much fun... 	I'll have to get back to you.3 free ideas for Hacker News	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/23/can.gif" width="95" height="129" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named can.gif">The other day I &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/may/hackerNewsIsDepressing">suggested&amp;lt;/a> perhaps adding blocking to HN, mostly as a way of starting a discussion. And it led to some interesting ideas that I think are worth considering.	A lot of the personal attacks come from accounts created to post one message. The user has never commented before, or submitted a link to the site. 	So here are some ideas:		1. Add a waiting period before new accounts can post. Like &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state">registering&amp;lt;/a> a gun. 		2. Charge for creating an account. Maybe $5 or so. Not very much money, but perhaps enough to make someone think again. If they want to be anonymous, use Bitcoin. That's what it's for.		3. Automatically downvote posts from accounts created within the last hour. Make it clear to readers that this comment was made by a new account.	What made me think of this idea was yet another one-off &amp;lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5754974">flame&amp;lt;/a> from a user named &amp;lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=redmarx">redmarx&amp;lt;/a> who created the account 13 hours ago, the exact same time his post was created. Now what do you think is going on there? A courageous whistle-blower, or a coward who doesn't want to own his or her own words? :-)Icon Chooser Dialog	Our users love icons. 	I guess most users do, but people who write in outliners need a little more graphic relief because our work is totally text and structure. Adding a bit of graphics is like adding spice to a sauce. And they're fun!	We're lucky because &amp;lt;a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome&amp;lt;/a> is such a great collection of icons. And it keeps getting better. If you're developing web apps, you're nuts if you aren't using Font Awesome. Seriously.	Anyway, until &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.smallpicture.com/may2013/fargo065">Fargo 0.65&amp;lt;/a> it was a lot of work to add an icon to an outline. What changed is that we created an icon chooser dialog that makes it easy and fun. 	If you're using &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a>, you can try it out with the Icon Chooser command in the Outliner menu.	If you're not using Fargo, here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/demos/iconChooser.html">little demo app&amp;lt;/a> you can try. It doesn't do much but allow you to browse the icons. When you click on one, an alert pops up saying which icon you chose. 	If you're a programmer, the code is free to use under the GPL. That means any improvements you make must also be licensed under the GPL. And it would be nice if you said where you got it. :-)	&amp;lt;a href="https://github.com/scripting/Icon-Chooser">https://github.com/scripting/Icon-Chooser&amp;lt;/a>	Enjoy! Hacker News is depressing	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/21/trashcan.gif" width="125" height="170" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named trashcan.gif">Yesterday someone at &amp;lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News&amp;lt;/a> thought to point to my &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/may/myOneTalkWithMarissaMayer">piece&amp;lt;/a> about Marissa Mayer. It was a story I wrote in about 15 minutes. The point was at the end of the piece. As a preamble, I told a couple of stories from my personal experience. I figured it would get a few comments, maybe a couple of thousand reads, and that would be that. But the torrent of abuse on Hacker News was something that I haven't seen in a long time.	One of the main reasons it doesn't work is that people don't ask questions to clarify. They jump to conclusions, some of which are very wrong. For example, they assumed I was the only person who was concerned about the BlogThis! button. Not true. 	They assumed that I was being "egotistical" for thinking that Google ever cared what I thought, and arrogant that I think they should care what I think now. It's a fact that at one point, early-on, Google did care. Their chief PR person was from Apple, &amp;lt;a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2063209/Marketing-Head-Cindy-McCaffrey-Leaving-Google">Cindy McCaffrey&amp;lt;/a>, a class act in every way. She would routinely send emails to me and Doc Searls asking our opinions. Whether anyone else there cared, I don't know. But I was invited to a meeting with engineers to talk about blogging, RSS and XML-RPC at one point. I can't imagine why they would ask me to tell them what I think if they didn't care. I suppose it might have been a big conspiracy, like Mission Impossible. Hey I wouldn't put it past some of the trolls on Hacker News to argue that. :-)	On the other hand, I don't take it personally that Google doesn't care what I think these days, partially because I don't think they care what &amp;lt;i>anyone&amp;lt;/i> thinks. That's a long story all by itself. 	Now, we could have had an interesting discussion on HN if people would have asked questions for clarification instead of just piling on the abuse based on their impressions. That's taking them at face-value, assuming they really want an informative discussion. Probably the trolls in the thread, and their upvoters, wanted nothing like that.	There were some other ludicrous statements. Did any of them know that I started a new company in December, and we shipped our first &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">two&amp;lt;/a> &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">products&amp;lt;/a> in March and April? They said I thought JavaScript was a bad language. How funny, because I'm writing almost all my code these days in JavaScript. They say I'm old and out of date. Funny. They're the ones who are out of date! :-)	And if you say someone's old as a way of hurting them, the joke will eventually come back to hurt you. As one of the characters of Citizen Kane, Bernstein, &amp;lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/quotes">said&amp;lt;/a> so eloquently, old age is the one disease you don't look forward to being cured of. It comes to everyone. I was young once. Now I'm middle-aged. Truth. And the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. I don't see what it has to do with the point of my blog post. 	Now I think there's a solution to letting the assholes control the conversation...	As discourse has moved to Twitter, its big contribution has been to push aside the abuse that's common with discussion boards and mail lists. A very simple feature in Twitter, the block command, enforces decorum, by empowering the listener to turn you off if they find you offensive. People learn that if they say abusive things, they don't have to listen. The only people I listen to on Twitter are those who can make a point without getting personal. I learn from disagreement, but I can't stand people who use their freedom to speak as a way of hurting others. 	Then I wondered -- if it works so well for Twitter -- why can't sites block Hacker News if the abuse gets too heavy? After yesterday's experience I probably would do it. I like the flow they deliver, but I hate the abuse. 	So I have a suggestion for Paul Graham, the guy who runs Hacker News. Give sites the option of blocking links from Hacker News. I honestly don't care what the HN trolls, and the people who upvote them, supposedly "think" about me. None of it is based on anything real. A lot of it is anonymous. Sometimes people create accounts just for the purpose of dropping a big smelly turd in the middle of a discussion. 	Let's learn a trick from Twitter, and cut off the trolls at the source. 	PS: I subscribe to the Hacker News feed, which does not include comments. It's very useful stuff. So the links themselves are good.I tried Google Glass	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/20/glass.gif" width="115" height="199" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named glass.gif">I went to dinner last night with the two Scobles, Robert and Patrick.	Robert is famous for the picture of him wearing a Google Glass while in the shower. 	Last night, he was wearing the glasses most of the dinner, but &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8755166253/">took them off&amp;lt;/a>. He said I should try them. I did.	What you get is a sequence of cards, with recent tweets, emails, Google Now type stuff. You scroll through them by swiping on the stem of the glasses. It doesn't take any time to get the hang of it.	You can create tweets with voice. It happened so quickly I barely knew I had done it. I created a tweet on Scoble's account. It contained an expletive which they conveniently ***'ed out for me. 	It was nice. However I don't feel any lust for having one of my own. I carry an Android phone and an iPad with me most places. The UI of Google Glass, while interesting, doesn't seem to be an improvement over the phone interface.	But it's early days. Maybe someone will figure this out. The Apple II wasn't much use before &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc">Visicalc&amp;lt;/a>, for example. The Mac came with a couple of demo apps, but didn't blossom until there were 20 or 30 useful pieces of software for it (it needed more of an ecosystem than an individual killer app). My one talk with Marissa Mayer	It was 2003. Google had just bought &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)">Blogger&amp;lt;/a>. On the acquisition, they said they wouldn't do anything to tilt the table in favor of Blogger. There was &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/2003/06/28.html#When:11:55:25AM">concern&amp;lt;/a> in the wider blogging community that Google might use its power in search to give people an incentive to use Blogger over other publishing platforms. They said this would never happen. 	But a few weeks after the deal they broke the promise. They added a &amp;lt;a href="http://support.google.com/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=41469">BlogThis!&amp;lt;/a> button to Google Toolbar. It only worked with Blogger. It would have been a simple matter to make it work with any blogging tool. But they didn't see why they should do that.		It would have been okay if Blogger was the default. But give the users a preference to set the address of our blogging platform. 	Back then Google cared a little about what I thought, so the result was a conference call between me and an exec at Google, Marissa Mayer. I was driving cross-country from California to Boston, so I stopped in Utah, in the parking lot of a 7-11 just east of Salt Lake City, and we had the call. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/21/fargo.gif" width="100" height="110" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named fargo.gif">&amp;lt;/a>All I remember of it was there came a point in the conversation when Mayer had had enough. She just got up and left. I think the people remaining in the conference room were a little embarassed. Google didn't do anything to change the BlogThis! button.	All this is to say that the promises execs make on acquisitions are meaningless. They own the thing, they will do what they want to with it. It doesn't matter how many nice sounds Mayer makes on the deal. At the core she cares not one bit what the users of Tumblr think. She's saying what she needs to say to make the deal happen. To avoid a PR crisis on Day One. To make the team at Tumblr feel like their work has value to the new owners. That somehow this acquisition isn't actually an acquisition.	I have some intuition about this myself, because I sold a &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext">company&amp;lt;/a>. We were bought because we had a presence in the Mac market, which was highly coveted at the time. I negotiated for myself a role as the "Chief architect of Symantec's Mac strategy." A few weeks after the deal I made a presentation to the exec staff about what our Mac strategy would be. Only one person showed up, the president of the company, Gordon Eubanks. He watched a couple of slides and thanked me for the input. I asked What about my chief architect role? He told me that was something they told me to get me to do the deal. 	He left the room. What was I going to do? What &amp;lt;i>could&amp;lt;/i> I do? Nothing, that's what. :-)	Moral of the story: When you sell your company, no matter what promises were made, you sold it. It's theirs now. They will do what they want to with it. Promises don't matter. Yahoo buying Tumblr	It looks like Yahoo is buying Tumblr.	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/19/champagne.gif" width="115" height="235" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named champagne.gif">I feel some sense of pride here because Tumblr is a descendent of products I made, Manila and Radio, that laid the groundwork for products like theirs. David Karp and Marco Arment will get rich (or richer) and that's cool because they're smart people who worked hard and made something real happened. I am in awe of systems that handle as much content as Tumblr. Their users should be in awe as well, imho.	Yet we still don't have a whole system for product development in this industry.	The rewards for digging the first holes that become the foundations for great systems like Tumblr and WordPress are minimal, if they exist at all. When you try to talk with investors about kicking back a bit of their proceeds in ventures that in addition providing good ROI, also create open formats and protocols that industries can be built on, you get blank stares. As if they don't understand. Of course they &amp;lt;i>do&amp;lt;/i> understand, it's just easier to pretend they don't.	They profit from this work, but like the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Grasshopper">grasshopper&amp;lt;/a> in the famous fable, they aren't willing to participate in the investment that made the profit possible. Too bad, because if they did -- I think their companies would be stronger as a result. The better the foundation, the bigger the building you can make, and the more efficient it is to keep it running. Had we had a longer easier runway for Radio and Manila, Tumblr might have gone further on less investment. 	Anyway, that's a small point right now. Get out the champagne and celebrate, because some of the good guys won. (Or at least appear to have, we'll find out for sure tomorrow.)Users mail list for Dropbox	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/18/drum.gif" width="135" height="112" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named drum.gif">I've been wondering lately why there has been so little useful stuff written about &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a>. It's an interesting product from a lot of angles. 	So I've been asking questions, and this is what I've figured out.	1. There are great places to go for reviews of Mac products. 	2. If you want to know about software that's sold on Amazon, you'll find lots of reviews from users. I understand that well because I depend on reviews for almost everything I buy on Amazon. 	3. For IOS and Android apps there are the stores, which have reviews.	But there is no place, that I know for Dropbox users to find out what the great apps are and what users are doing with them. 	Probably because Dropbox as a platform is so new? 	It's like a fog here, because we're all operating with so little information. 	So let's solove the problem. I started a mail list today for users of Dropbox who want to be in the loop on all kinds of new products. Obviously it's a chicken and egg thing. If enough users show up, the developers will follow, and vice versa. 	&amp;lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/dropbox-users">https://groups.google.com/forum/dropbox-users&amp;lt;/a>	We'll probably need some rules of conduct at some point, or move to a blog or blogs, because mail lists always tend to flame out if there's no moderation, but for now, it's a good way for people to meet, if there's enough interest.	As a vendor of a Dropbox-based product, I can tell you I am highly motivated to see this work. Most people who use Dropbox, some of whom would love a great outliner, don't know my product exists. I want desperately to fix that. :-)Google is the new MSM	&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulworth">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/17/bulworth.gif" width="115" height="170" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named bulworth.gif">&amp;lt;/a>Last night watching the NBA on TNT, new commercials for the YouTube comedy fest. The production was distinctly &amp;lt;i>not&amp;lt;/i> YouTube. It was professional in every way. Nothing amateur about it. Google is now &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media">MSM&amp;lt;/a>. All that talk about &amp;lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57584689-93/googles-page-wants-a-tech-burning-man/">Burning Man&amp;lt;/a> is sleight of hand. That guy has as much in common with you and me as Rupert Murdoch does. 	It's not just Google, Twitter is also MSM. Facebook? Eh. Their presence on TV is mostly in URLs at the bottom of other peoples' ads. Their commercials are amateurish, awful imitations of other tech company commercials. Not to say they're the only ones with awful commercials, but theirs are awful in their amateurishness. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2013/05/17/google-reader-google-plus-and-the-future-of-social-networks/">A blog post&amp;lt;/a> on Forbes suggests that Google is going to bring RSS back in a MSM-type way. You'll be able to follow Blogger blogs in Google Plus. Maybe they'll make a deal with Automattic and Tumblr to make it possible to follow their blogs too. Me and you? Well we can be followed, but only if we use one of the silos. We have to be locked in &amp;lt;i>someone's&amp;lt;/i> trunk to participate.	The web is going to play the same role to all this crazy locked up stuff that it played to MSM in the 90s. We're going to be the oddballs. The ones with amateurish sites. We'll be the artisans, the local farmers of ideas. The ones that lack polish but speak from our experience. We'll do what &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulworth">Bulworth&amp;lt;/a> so famously did. I don't have access, and I don't want it. I'd much prefer to hear from other people who don't have access and don't want it.		&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HrRobSIeeC4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	The web keeps moving. If your attention has shifted and you can't see that, that's not the same thing as the web being lost. Maybe &amp;lt;i>you&amp;lt;/i> got lost? :-)Why Dave Wynn uses Fargo	Over on our Community Feed for Fargo users, a conversation started about how people are loving writing code with Fargo. This really surprised me, because we haven't done much to encourage this. There's a simple feature in the app that allows you to run a single-line of JavaScript code. This means you can call any routine that's in Fargo, or in Bootstrap, jQuery or in the core JavaScript libraries. 	We have it in there because it's useful for one-liners, for debugging the app. It's not meant to make it a programming environment. But some people seem to love it. I wanted to know why, so I asked. And what came back from Dave Wynn, a user who I had not met until this exchange, was a simple and eloquent explanation of why Fargo is a great product (I happen to agree with him of course, but then it's partly my creation). Here's what he said, of course in an outline (Fargo is an outliner).	&amp;lt;rules (blogSectionsRules)>	It's as cross platform as it gets		I use Windows at work and Linux at home, and making everything play nice (even with Dropbox) can be a &amp;lt;b>HUGE&amp;lt;/b> pain		Linux also doesn't get a lot of love with regard to clean, user-focused apps	It's file backed		I couldn't get into Workflowy because I couldn't trust that they wouldn't just disappear one day, leaving all of my thoughts unavailable in the ether		I got into org-mode precisely because of this, but it took a lot of tweaking in order to work, and even then still missed some basic things like spell-check (which needed a diferent engine for each platform... see above)	I can inspect it much more easily than other software		Sure I know I can't see everything that's going on, but I can press the F12 key, and that makes little mods much more possible for a beginner like me	Feedback is immediate		CSS changes kick in right away, and there's no crazy compile step in order to get things rightWorking without servers	One of our fetishes at Small Picture is getting cool stuff working with no servers.	You can get a lot done. For example -- &amp;lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&amp;lt;/a>. There's only one function it relies on a server for, the importing of OPML. And if you think about it, it's ridiculous that that function has to be done through a server. The code is running in a browser, which is perfectly suited to get a file over the Internet. 	Many of the limits of the 2013 web are accidents of history. Someone at some time thought an operation was too powerful, that it could be abused, so they made it illegal. But they didn't close off the ability to call a server to do it for us, so we effectively can do anything we need to do. 	A great example of that is the way Dropbox allows &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a> to save to the local file system. 	This is something we're not supposed to be able to do. But we're doing it anyway. And nothing is breaking as far as I can tell. We're inside a very simple easy to understand sandbox, a sub-folder of the Dropbox folder. 	And in addition to being able to write to the local file system, we get cross-device synchronization for free. That's a great deal. (Understatement.)	All this means things are shifting pretty radically. Who is the operating system vendor if my files are equally accessible on Windows, Mac, Android, Linux, IOS, etc? Dropbox is, that's who. 	A couple of years ago I asked the guys at &amp;lt;a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic&amp;lt;/a> to add a feature to their API that would allow me to store a small XML file along with a blog post. Had they done this, and if we had followed where it would logically have led, today they would have the equivalent of Dropbox, along with content management. You'd be able to publish just by saving a file. 	Today you have to figure Dropbox sees this opportunity. And that they will, eventually, navigate to roughly where WordPress is. 	The server is moving. A fair amount of what used to be "up there" is now in JavaScript, in the browser. The network services are doing what only they can do, provide global access to published information. And unfortunately due to history, they are also acting as pointless proxies for things a browser app should be able to do for itself.What's new (or broken) with the Twitter API?	My linkblogging tool, &amp;lt;a href="http://docs.reallysimple.org/">Radio2&amp;lt;/a>, has a connection with Twitter. You can establish a link between your feed and Twitter so that every item in your feed is also posted to Twitter. 	Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/15/blueBirdIcon.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a>. To create the connection you click on the blue bird. That starts an OAuth conversation where the user gives Radio2 permission to post to his or her Twitter account.	I've been hearing, peripherally, that some part of the old Twitter API is about to be turned off, or maybe has already been turned off. I can't pay full attention because it's a small feature, used by just a few people, and I have my attention elsewhere.	Late last night I tried clicking on the blue bird, and sure enough there appears to be some breakage. Twitter &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/15/twitterError.gif">complains&amp;lt;/a> that there is "no request token for this page." Perhaps they changed something in their OAuth implementation?	I should investigate.	If you have any clues, please post a comment.	Thanks! :-)We need a curator for the Apple river	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/11/bus.gif" width="250" height="176" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named bus.gif">I did a house-cleaning on my river server on May 9. At that time some of the rivers stopped updating. Mostly the ones that no longer have tabs in the user interface because either I personally didn't have enough interest in the subject and not many other people were reading them. I didn't feel like paying for machine resources if only one or two people were reading the flow, or if there were only one or two new items a week. 	One of the rivers that I turned off is the &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=apple">Apple river&amp;lt;/a>. I use a Mac, several in fact. And I have an iPad and an iPod. I am a long-time Apple shareholder. I am an Apple user, but I am not a dedicated member of the Apple community like some people I respect are. For example, Brent Simmons, Marco Arment, John Gruber, Daniel Jalkut or Michael Gartenberg. I see a tremendous value in the river, if only someone rooted in the community would take an interest. It's also a potential money-maker, imho.	It's really time for communities to spread out and become more inclusive. With a well-curated river, the Mac community can explore more niches, and grow in some interesting ways, perhaps.	So I offer to keep running the river...	1. If someone with a site with serious flow offers to display the river on their site, linked to from their home page.	2. It can be rendered in their template.	3. I will provide support on the technical process for getting the river to display well in another site. It involves using jQuery, something I'm not an expert in. But I got it to work here, so I presume we can get it working anywhere. If we need help I know where to ask for it. ;-)	4. The curator has to have the ability to edit an OPML subscription list, and make it available at a public HTTP address. Fargo, my outliner, does this very nicely, in conjunction with Dropbox. But you can use any tool you like.	5. The person doing the curating and the person doing the display can be different people, if you like.	6. Curating here means choosing feeds, not stories. We're looking for good sources of Mac news and opinion. But it's up to those sources to decide what goes in the river. It's just an RSS aggregator on the back-end.	7. All I want in return is a link from the page back to a page that shows people how to set up their own rivers, which I will write. It won't be hype-ish. I may ask for a little money for the software.  	I think the Apple river is a great place to start. Now I'm looking for one of the leaders in the Mac blogging world to step up and work with me on this. I may not be a Mac insider these days, but I go back to the beginning. I was onstage at the Mac rollout in 1984. I had an ad in the first issue of MacWorld. My product won the top Eddy in 1986. I used to go to WWDC back when it was in San Jose. I even &amp;lt;i>spoke&amp;lt;/i> at WWDC one year. Ask Guy Kawasaki. ;-)	Let's do this. I think it'll turn out to be an important step in the growth of the Mac blogosphere. Should the Community Feed be an RSS feed in addition to being an OPML feed?	&amp;lt;i>This question came up in the Community Feed, which you can read in Fargo, by choosing the Community Feed command from the &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/10/docsmenu.gif">Docs menu&amp;lt;/a>. Or you can read it in the &amp;lt;a href="http://reader.smallpicture.com/?opmlurl=http://smallpicture.com/feed.opml">Small Picture Reader&amp;lt;/a> if you don't use Fargo. I wrote my answer there, but thought it would be interesting to also post it here. No I didn't use the fancy &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/may/aRenaissanceInBlogging">Blogging 2.0&amp;lt;/a> protocol I described in an earlier post. Soooon!&amp;lt;/i>	Well of course it would be nice to have everything, if there were no cost. 	It would take time to write the code and keep it running. It would be worth doing if there would be a lot of people using it. But right now the Community Feed a new feature. We're still at the point where we're introducing ourselves. If that's all it does it will have been worth it.	I'm an investor in software, and I have to make decisions as any investor would. I can't buy everything. And right now there are other projects that I think need more attention. 	Also, and this is a key point, this is not something you need Kyle or me to do. The &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/feed.opml">OPML feed&amp;lt;/a> is public. If you want to write the code to convert it to an RSS feed, you can do it. 		Read it once every ten minutes. Use the eTag feature of HTTP to conserve bandwidth. Generate RSS 2.0. How will you synthesize a title for each item? I don't know, that's a hard problem. RSS 2.0 doesn't require titles, but Google Reader did. That made generating RSS feeds a difficult process for data that doesn't inherently have titles. But Google Reader is going away, so we're free to do as we please, you say. Not so fast. The replacements are clones. I bet they're just as picky as GR was. At least until the dust settles, and that isn't going to happen this year even, probably. 	But OPML feeds? Ahhh that's easy. Since I'm writing both ends I can make it work. And if I want to change things based on what I learn, I can do that too. That's why the early days on anything are important. And why you should go slowly enough so you can feed back what you learn into the protocol. 	Anyway you see these questions sound simple, but when you actually start writing the code, they can become complex. 	Bottom-line: My bet is that no one would use an RSS feed of this content. That makes it a bad investment. I've been wrong before, btw.Standards for Rivers	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule level="2" to="2">			&amp;lt;font-family>Georgia&amp;lt;/font-family>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	Jay Rosen wrote me last week to say that the River of News concept had reached a tipping point. That led me to &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/may/whatIsARiverOfNews">publish&amp;lt;/a> a brief email exchange with Brent Simmons about what a river is, from a design standpoint. But there's more to rivers than their form, there are a couple of other very important ways to look at them:		1. &amp;lt;b>Standardization&amp;lt;/b>.			The Mac beat the IBM PC because there were user interface standards. If I learned how to use a couple of apps, I was actually learning how to use all of them. If your river and my river work and act differently, we have no advantage, and people are going to stay with Twitter, because there, the UI for all rivers is the same. True, it's limited to 140 characters, but the advantages of standardization make Twitter easy and familiar.			It should also be possible for users to combine rivers. I want Reuters and Wired rivers, for example, but I don't want to go to two places to view their news. Again with standards, we don't have to force readers to make a choice. This means growth for the alternate-Twitter, which is the potential of news moving to rivers. 			Standardization is something the tech industry has a hard time with. But my experience with news and RSS is that it's not as much of a problem with publishing. Once we had the NYT on board, all the other pubs followed, compatibly, without the usual fighting that happens in tech.				However now that they have been hiring programmers, lots of them, they're becoming more like the tech industry, in not-positive ways.			I offer the &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave">format&amp;lt;/a> we're using for rivers. It's a simple jQuery template, and an equally simple &amp;lt;a href="http://riverjs.org/">JSON format&amp;lt;/a>. The template was designed by an open &amp;lt;a href="http://beautriver1.blorkmark.com/">community&amp;lt;/a> in a Google Group a couple of years ago. I designed the JSON format to help define the problem for the group. It was a wonderfully successful open collaboration. I hope other people just use it as-is. 		2. &amp;lt;b>Open the doors&amp;lt;/b>.			This part, I believe, will be difficult for news organizations. But, if you want to compete with Twitter, you have to include bloggers in your stream. I don't mean reporters who call themselves bloggers, rather people who have expertise or experience that makes them the kind of people reporters like to quote. People whose ideas you think are dangerous. More of that. 			News needs reforming, literally, it needs to be formed again around the new reality -- we all have printing presses. News will never reform itself until it feels the pressure from the sources, where it matters most, on the screens of their readers.			We need to have one environment where professional reporters, sources and critics co-mingle their thoughts. We don't need a Public Editor as much as we need The Public. That's why Twitter has been so popular, but it's unfortunate that the news industry has been unwilling to meet them there. Blogging 2.0	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;font-family>Georgia&amp;lt;/font-family>			&amp;lt;line-height>160%&amp;lt;/line-height>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	I wrote a piece in August 2012 which I posted on Medium entitled &amp;lt;a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/349109119cee">We Could Make History&amp;lt;/a>, in which I proposed that we get together and create a new API to connect authoring tools to publishing environments. 	At the time I thought it was a long shot, but worth putting it out there in case anyone was listening at Medium, or elsewhere. That's why I made it openly. And why I put the post on Medium.	Today I'm writing this post on my own blogging platform, which is more or less some scaffolding I put together to hook my outliner up to the web, so I could publish, before we had something real that others could use. 	Now I can make a more concrete proposal because &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a> is visible, people can better imagine what I'm talking about.	1. I don't like the idea of writing something to have it visible in only one place.	2. Sometimes I find that a comment I wrote in one place is really a blog post, but why should it stop being a comment?	3. Copy/paste is an awful synch protocol. It's 2013. We can do better! In fact we live in a time of great progress in sychronization, thanks to Dropbox. Publishing should make the leap into the future as well.	4. Software now runs in the browser, written in JavaScript. It's indistinguishable from desktop software. So any protocol we come up with must work equally well with JS apps running in the browser.	5. Meanwhile there are a number of projects underway to bring blogging up to date. But they're doing it without APIs and without feeds. Why? That's not really progress. 	6. We were able to hook up &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.smallpicture.com/may2013/fargo054">Fargo to WordPress&amp;lt;/a>, largely to show what's possible. But we had to set up a proxy server so that our JS app running in the browser could call their server. This is a waste of resources and does not scale.	7. We will have a for-real CMS running on a server. It will do things that are new, that none of the other publishing platforms do. But there will still be things they do that we don't. APIs are needed. But I'd prefer to work with others to come up with the API, rather than do both ends myself. If we do it that way we get there sooner, better.	8. I'm pretty sure there will be APIs here. But I'd rather there just be one. We had that worked out pretty well in Blogging 1.0. But let's do it even better in 2.0.	9. Who wants to go first? :-)Community Feed in Fargo 0.59	&amp;lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/g85e5lB6pqw?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	More about &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.smallpicture.com/may2013/fargo059CommunityFeed">Fargo 0.59&amp;lt;/a>.Levy on BigCo innovation	&amp;lt;a href="http://qz.com/82090/big-companies-cant-accomodate-big-ideas/">Levy&amp;lt;/a>: "To really think big, you can't be at a big company."	I was amazed that these words came from Steven Levy, former Newsweek tech reporter, and late of Wired. He's spent a career supporting the myth not just that big ideas can come from big companies, but that they &amp;lt;i>only&amp;lt;/i> come from big companies. 	He was paraphrasing Evan Williams, founder of Twitter and Blogger. But it's still an amazing transformation.	Now, I don't expect the press to all of a sudden start reporting on where big ideas actually come from. But it's nice to be able to point to the truth, just once, from such a source. 	BTW, we're thinking very big at Small Picture. :-)Q&amp;A w/Brent re River of News	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;font-family>Palatino&amp;lt;/font-family>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	&amp;lt;i>On April 11, &amp;lt;a href="http://inessential.com/">Brent Simmons&amp;lt;/a> sent an email, included below.

I'm not trying to be obtuse about this -- I want to be sure I understand.	I think it's something like this, but I'm not sure which parts are optional, and I might be missing things.	1. It presents a list of articles from multiple feeds in a scrollable list.		Yes.	2. There might be multiple scrollable lists -- tabs of some kind.		Not required, but you can do it that way (I have it with my &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave">mediahackers&amp;lt;/a> site). But each one is a river, not the whole thing.	3. Items in the list are sorted in reverse-chronological order by arrival date (date the feed scanner saw the item) rather than by pubDate. (True?)		True. By arrival date. pubDate is not important for ordering.	4. Items are presented with title, link, and an excerpt. The excerpt should be just long enough to be meaningful (around 280 characters).		You could leave out the excerpt and it would still be a river. The important thing is that the excerpt be of determinate length, and short enough so you can see a lot of items on screen at the same time.	5. It handles edited items by ____? (I don't know. Does it show them again?)		Does not show edited items again. 	6. There is no notion of read/unread whatsoever, and thus no unread counts.		Correct. No notion of read/unread. 	7. There is no notion of starred (or flagged, or saved) items whatsoever. (Users can blog, send to a read-it-later service, etc. as they normally would for any web page.)		Not true -- you can do whatever you want there. I include a RT link on my items. Just as long as it's small and doesn't interfere with skimming.	8. A river of news feed scanner outputs &amp;lt;a href="http://riverjs.org/">river.js&amp;lt;/a> data. (Is this optional? Could it be RSS?)		Not required. It would however be useful to have a standard here. I want to write all my displayers in JS running in the browser. 	9. Do river-of-news readers have to be web pages? Could an iOS or Mac app qualify, if it met all the criteria?		Of course it could be an IOS app. 		The main idea aren't the details, but the way its used. I can scroll back to the point where I hit something I seen. Quickly. My memory is perfectly capable of telling me I've seen something before. You can rely on it, people can do this. 11th hour for news nets	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/06/twitter-hiring-head-of-news-journalism">Michael Wolff comments&amp;lt;/a> on the job ad that Twitter is running, looking for a manager of news. 	He suggests existing news execs, and that's probably the kind of person Twitter is looking for for this job.	It's a head-fake. This guy is a figure-head. He or she will be working with media companies, speaking at conferences, talking about how Twitter is helping media companies succeed in the age of realtime Internet-delivered news. He or she is a feel-good ambassador to the news industry. A person handing out complementary samples of pasta and baked goods while the real action is elsewhere. 	The job is a bedtime story. News will be as it always was, with familiar faces and jobs, just with a new delivery system.	Meanwhile, the news system of the future is booting up all around Twitter, which is and always has been a &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html">coral reef&amp;lt;/a>. They need a new shipwreck to build around, and this time the sunken ship is the remains of the news industry.	Even at this late hour, I have a recommendation to any player in the news industry.	1. Create a &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave">river of news&amp;lt;/a> and put it on your home page.	2. Include all the news from your own organization, but include news from bloggers in your community. 	3. Include the feeds of your competitors. 	4. Deliver the best news product you can with today's technology. You can link from the river to stuff behind your paywall, if you must, but the river itself must be freely accessible. Think of it as a river of ads for full-length stories. 	5. No 140-char limit. Pick a higher number. There should still be a limit to the length of a synopsis. 500 characters is plenty. Most NYT synopses are &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/03/24/howBigIsANuggetofnews.html">much shorter&amp;lt;/a> than that. 	6. Make nice with Twitter. You can do a head-fake too. :-)Managing expectations	In software, mis-managed expectation can be as damning as it is in sports and politics.	For example, coming into a political debate, each side tries to portray the other as vastly superior, in every way. If you can get the expectation low enough for your guy, he or she might "win" just by showing up. 	In sport, where the outcome is measured more definitely, in points on a scoreboard, you manage expectation to play with the mind of your opponent. An over-confident adversary might relax, and create openings. The Knicks almost lost to the Celtics that way.	In software, I've seen it happen over and over. I've never had to deal with too-high expectations, but my competitors have. The first time I encountered it, with competition from a much-bigger Lotus Development, I was scared. But when we survived the competition without a scratch, I learned that just because everyone thinks you're going to lose, don't necessarily make it so. 	I wasn't happy to see the expectations so high for the vaporware product Diaspora. The kids behind it were too young and inexperienced to know how much work there is in creating a finished usable product. Academia, which generally doesn't have much respect for commercial development, doesn't help. The result was awful.	Coach Bill Walsh of the 49ers had this down. Before a big game he'd always pump up the skill and courage of his opponent. Why not? Maybe they'll get over-confident. Either way, if he wins, he just vanquished a superior adversary. And if they lost, he gets to shrug it off with an I-told-you-so.	In sport, politics or software, no one cares how great you think you are. What matters is what happens on the playing field. Did you win or lose? And did you do it with grace?RFC: Markdown and outliners	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/04/drummer.gif" width="105" height="192" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named drummer.gif">I've had &amp;lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown&amp;lt;/a> on my to-do list for a few months, and the other day, with a bit of blank space in my worklist, I decided to give it a shot. 	It was amazingly easy to integrate into our JavaScript app. I just downloaded the source for &amp;lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/">Pagedown&amp;lt;/a>, the Markdown interpreter used by Stack Overflow. I put it into a file on our server, and included it in &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a>. Added a command to the File menu, and came up with a &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/fargoDocs.html#markdown">simple way&amp;lt;/a> to generate it for users. The whole thing was done in a couple of hours.	Now we need people who know Markdown and outliners to take a look at this, try it out and relatively quickly, before there's an installed base to break, figure out if there's anything special we need to do, because this is an outliner and not a straight text editor.	Here are a couple of considerations:	1. Should we generate one or two return chars at the end of every outline heading? At first we did one, then thought better and generated two, but now we're back at one. Pretty sure one is the right answer. We often think of a headline as a paragraph, but sometimes headlines are titles. Markdown views titles and paragraphs very differently.	2. Indentation. I thought at first that we should generate a tab for every level, but backed out of that idea quickly because Markdown treats tabs as very special characters. Everything deeper than level 0 would be seen as preformatted code. Not the desired outcome.	So I wonder if there have been any others who have integrated outlining and Markdown before? If so, what did they do here? 	See the &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/fargoDocs.html#markdown">Fargo docs&amp;lt;/a> for an idea how it works from a user's standpoint. 	I welcome any comments from Markdown experts (I am anything but that).Fargo and Markdown	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/03/drummer.gif" width="105" height="192" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named drummer.gif">A quick note about a new development with our Fargo outliner. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a> now has a &amp;lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown&amp;lt;/a> processor baked-in. This means that a user can write a Markdown-formatted outline, and generate HTML from it, with a single command in the File menu.		We're using the open source &amp;lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/">Pagedown&amp;lt;/a> library. 	Markdown and text go together, by design. Outliners are text editors, a special kind that understand structure. There is a structure to Markdown, as there is structure to HTML, but so far as we know, none of the Markdown editors have been outliners. 	How the connection with outlines and Markdown will proceed is an unknown. By baking in Markdown we're asking a simple question. &amp;lt;i>How does this work?&amp;lt;/i> We hope to hear from users and other smart people who have ideas. 	This feature is available in &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.smallpicture.com/may2013/fargo055">Fargo 0.55&amp;lt;/a>, which is now released on the site. 	&amp;lt;i>Let's have fun!&amp;lt;/i> :-)The Knicks as a metaphor	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/02/knicks.gif" width="145" height="145" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named knicks.gif">A number of Knicks players did something extremely stupid when they dressed in black for last night's game, saying they were dressing for the Celtics' funeral. These guys may be talented athletes, but they don't understand sports. Amazingly. How could they get that far in the NBA without understanding that you don't celebrate until you win. I know they're young. I wonder if they've ever heard about &amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPKPgnIOKJA">Game 6&amp;lt;/a> of the 1986 World Series. 		&amp;lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XPKPgnIOKJA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	Sports, if it teaches us anything, it's how to struggle against our folly. How not to tempt fate. How to manage our own presence.	Look at the incredible baskets these guys make. But they only make them when they're grounded, in the moment, feeling the energy, whatever it is. So JR Smith started celebrating after they had a solid lead in Game 3. He got ejected, and suspended, and not only wasn't there to help in Game 4, he broke the bubble around the Knicks, that had been around the team since they emerged from an awful funk in February. Now we have to wonder if they can get it back. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44knT22P1aw&amp;feature=player_embedded">The Celtics&amp;lt;/a>, last night, walking off the court, may have helped the Knicks get back in the groove, repeating trash talk about Carmelo's wife. I'm just theorizing, lip-reading. But maybe he'll get angry and really &amp;lt;i>want&amp;lt;/i> to win. That's probably all it takes.	Meanwhile in Oklahoma City, the Thunder coach thought he could sneak by the Rockets with a &amp;lt;a href="http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/05/02/scott-brooks-lets-omer-asik-steal-the-show-from-kevin-durant-and-james-harden-in-thunders-game-5-loss-to-rockets/">trick&amp;lt;/a>. Oh how sad. Kevin Durant who I thought was a true fighter, is instead mired in self-pity. And the Rockets, a young, smart, admirable -- wonderful group of young men -- are pushing every one of their buttons, artfully. They might pull out the upset. Amazing parallels between the Celtics and the Rockets. One team old, one young. Both not going out peacefully. 	All this is a metaphor for my former friend Mike Arrington, who may be the JR Smith of tech. He was celebrating the demise of RSS while the body was still breathing. He had no clue that he had won, or that anyone was keeping score. 	Technology isn't all that different from basketball. There's teamwork, and bubbles of energy, and franchises. RSS is not something that dies, any more than the NBA dies. Players come and go, there are generations -- the Patrick Ewing Knicks and the Bernard King Knicks. Now we have the Carmelo Anthony Knicks. But RSS, like the NBA is bigger than me or Mike. He doesn't get to say it's dead. RSS just laughs, shrugs it off and keeps on going.The Fargo-WordPress connection	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/05/02/wheel.gif" width="115" height="115" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named wheel.gif">My &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">outliner&amp;lt;/a> is an authoring tool. I think of it as the hub of a wheel with lots of spokes. At the end of each spoke is a way to communicate. 	Some of the spokes lead to private places, for example, the worknotes I share with my programming partner. No one else sees those. But then there are blog posts, like the one you're reading now. At the end of this spoke is software I wrote that renders an outline in this form. I'm one of a small number of people, today, using that method of rendering. 	Yesterday we &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.smallpicture.com/may2013/fargo054">released&amp;lt;/a> a spoke that leads to WordPress, the popular open source blogging environment. You can now use &amp;lt;a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo&amp;lt;/a> to create and edit posts in WordPress. This works in two ways:		1. You can use the outliner to organize a library of posts you want to be able to access quickly.		2. You can use the outliner to structure each blog post. 			By default each level is represented in the blog post by indentation. But we also add CSS styles to each paragraph that indicate what level they are at. So a skilled CSS designer can set it up so that level indentation does much more to control the appearance of the text. I expect lots of interesting stuff to develop here.	Here are the &amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/fargoDocs.html#wordpress">docs&amp;lt;/a> for the feature, and a &amp;lt;a href="http://recentposts.smallpicture.com/">list&amp;lt;/a> of recent new posts written in Fargo.	Here's a homemade &amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCV9HJpeWWs&amp;feature=youtu.be">video demo&amp;lt;/a> of the new Fargo-WordPress connection.		&amp;lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zCV9HJpeWWs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	Over time you'll see us add more connection, and of course offer a general way for anyone to add new spokes to the wheel.

I was just going to order her the same printer I have.

Here it is.	Facebook has to do what they're doing because their stock is screwed and they're being run by Goldman Sachs now.	I thought it deserved a blog post cause it was so concise.Nexus 4 arrives	This &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8224352696/in/photostream/lightbox/">picture&amp;lt;/a> was taken with my Nexus 4 which arrived today.		&amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8224352696/in/photostream/lightbox/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/27/nexus4.jpg" width="450" height="338" border="0" alt="A picture named nexus4.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule level="1" to="1">			&amp;lt;font-weight>bold&amp;lt;/font-weight>			&amp;lt;permalink>true&amp;lt;/permalink>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	Micro-SIM issue		The first task will be to visit a nearby T-Mobile store to see if I can swap my old big SIM for the smaller one that the Nexus 4 takes. It may be that it doesn't take a T-Mobile SIM at all. I still am fuzzy on all this SIM stuff.		Here's the problem with the SIM illustrated in a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8223413665/in/photostream">picture&amp;lt;/a>. The SIM that I have is far too big for the adapter they provide.			&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/27/sim.jpg" width="400" height="264" border="0" alt="A picture named sim.jpg">		And here's the answer. It's a &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mattl/status/273452867770269696">matter&amp;lt;/a> of converting a full-size SIM to a micro-SIM. CNET has a &amp;lt;a href="http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57484847-285/how-to-cut-your-own-micro-sim-card/">tutorial&amp;lt;/a> that explains all the options, including DIY.		Update: The T-Mobile store on 8th Ave and 54th was able to fix it up in a few minutes. They were pretty impressed with my new phone. The guy said he was going to try to order one for himself later today. :-)	Dispatching pictures		The camera app seems to have a lot of features, but there doesn't appear to be a way to send a photo directly from the camera app to email or Twitter or whatever. I seem to remember that Android could do this. It's the first thing I look for. 		Several people recommend using the Gallery, but the best answer for me, so far, is to swipe from right to left. The camera viewfinder is replaced with a browser of past pictures. From there you can dispatch them where ever you want. 	Setting the wallpaper		It's really frustrating to set the wallpaper. I have a full-size &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8204355638/in/photostream/lightbox/">picture&amp;lt;/a> of the Mona Lisa, it makes a great background image for a cell phone. I use it on my iPad, my iPod and I want to use it on my Nexus 4. 		But the wall-paper setting function in the Settings only lets me select a very small portion of the picture. Can't figure out how to get it to zoom out. But when I display the picture in the Gallery app it works perfectly. And it works perfectly the first time on Apple's devices.		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/27/wallpaperandroid.jpg" width="259" height="427" border="0" alt="A picture named wallpaperandroid.jpg">		Update: I gave up and just used Google's wallpaper-setter app. It's confusing, but I've had it explained to me, and sort of understand. Turns out the Mona Lisa still looks good if you're just looking at a corner of it. Amazing painting that way. :-)	Video player		A few days ago I wrote how I &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/whyIQuitNetflix">quit Netflix&amp;lt;/a>. Partly because Amazon appears to be offering the same service as part of Amazon Prime, and I'm already a member of that (and it costs less than Netflix and I get free shipping).		Then I got the Nexus 4. And found out to my surprise that Amazon Instant Video isn't available for the Nexus 4. Too bad, because it's a very nice little computer for watching movies. I watched &amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0">Gangnan Style&amp;lt;/a> last night a few times and loved the video quality. 		But I can play MP4 movies on the device. So it's possible for some of my entertainment to be viewed there.Time for voter suppression trials	Now that some Republicans have &amp;lt;a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/early-voting-curbs-called-power-play/nTFDy/">confessed&amp;lt;/a> that the real purpose of Florida voter suppression was to disenfranchise voters in order to change the outcome of an election, it's time to arrest and prosecute some of the offenders. 		That's a bit too conservative. The purpose of voter suppression is to &amp;lt;i>steal&amp;lt;/i> an election. 	Let's see how well their excuses hold up in court with a jury of their peers (the people whose votes they were trying to suppress). 	I've had it with the government looking the other way on political crimes. We have a free system that guarantees every citizen a vote. Screwing with the election is a serious crime. 	Update: Thanks to &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/betsythedevine/status/273191055887839232">Betsy Devine&amp;lt;/a> for suggesting a &amp;lt;a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/arrest-and-prosecute-officials-who-tried-suppress-vote-2012-election/CbJJ66hN">petition&amp;lt;/a>.

Not clear until you know what the format is. And what the terms are. Bandwidth poverty	Yesterday I wrote a piece about &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/movieMonitor">information poverty&amp;lt;/a> from one point of view, but there's another -- bandwidth.	In New York, the largest city in the US, the bandwidth available to most residents is pitiful for 2012. There is some FIOS, but very little, and mostly in the outer boroughs. In Manhattan we get Time-Warner asymetric junk. 		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/26/speed.png" width="300" height="135" border="0" alt="A picture named speed.png">	Google is of course experimenting with &amp;lt;a href="https://fiber.google.com/about/">gigabit fiber&amp;lt;/a> in Kansas City, &amp;lt;s>and now &amp;lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/11/26/the-3-reasons-google-bought-wi-fi-provider-icoa/">they've&amp;lt;/a> &amp;lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/26/3692672/google-continues-its-isp-march-with-400-million-purchase-of-public-wi">bought&amp;lt;/a> a wifi service company&amp;lt;/s>. Ooops, turns out &amp;lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20121126/google-sources-say-company-didnt-buy-icoa-wireless/">that&amp;lt;/a> was a hoax! :-(	The short term solution to New York's connectivity problem isn't digging up the streets and laying fiber, it's wifi hotspots blanketing the city. Every cell phone, laptop and desktop computer comes with wifi today, world wide. It's the standard for the future. And you can get some pretty great throughput with wifi. Much better than the crap that cable companies offer today. And much much cheaper.	Google is probably going to price it at $0. :-)	I've long argued that the NY Times should solve the city's bandwidth problem and charge us a reasonable price for it. The window of opportunity for that may be closing pretty quicklyA time of information poverty	It's Sunday night of a Thanksgiving weekend in NY and there are a bunch of movies playing I haven't seen. But in NY it's hard to know, for me at least, when theaters will be crowded. Is this a good time to go to the movies if you like a relatively empty theater and a short popcorn line? 		Sometimes the theaters in NY are packed when you'd least expect it.	We live in a time of information poverty. Someday you'll tell your grandchildren there was a time when you couldn't zoom in on the local theater and see how many people had bought tickets for the show that starts in 25 minutes. 		It might help fill in the empty spots in theater's calendars. 		Related idea: I like to fly when the plane is pretty empty. 	Will we still have movie theaters then? Well, we don't really need them now, if it weren't for DRM and licensing we could watch them at home. But it is nice to go out to a movie. But maybe future generations will think that as quaint as the notion that it's nice to hold a paper book or printed news in your hands. Something about the smell of the ink or paper, I think. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/25/rotaryDialPhoneLarge.jpg">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/25/phone.gif" width="145" height="89" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named phone.gif">&amp;lt;/a>In 1990, I was at my brother's house in Palo Alto. It was about 9PM and we knew the Mets were playing the Dodgers in LA. We decided to try to find the score, using the means available in 1990. We called the stadium. And the newspapers in New York and Los Angeles. Someone somewhere knew the score, but we couldn't find them. 	A number of years before that, driving into San Francisco, I wondered how many people I knew there, and thought I probably knew quite a few. No way to find them in 1979. I figured &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=all+my+friends+who+live+in+the+bay+area&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=40.697488,-73.979681&amp;sspn=1.096351,1.104126&amp;hq=all+my+friends+who+live&amp;hnear=Bay+Area&amp;t=m&amp;z=10">someday&amp;lt;/a> I'd have all my contacts in a database and would be able to synch up with a global database with people's addresses. I'm not sure if Facebook can do that today, but they certainly have the data.	Someday we'll have a lot more usable information, if things go as they should, or so it seems. 	It might be interesting to think of what we'll need to get there, that we don't currently have. If anything. :-)Bullet points on Ev's new startup	I listened to a &amp;lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/75">podcast interview&amp;lt;/a> between Evan Williams and Jeffrey Zeldman yesterday. It had a few bits about &amp;lt;a href="http://medium.com/">Medium&amp;lt;/a>, which is his new startup. I am interested in know what his thinking is on this -- as we've been exploring the same territory for a number of years, and his ideas are always worth a listen.	Here's the executive summary -- he is exploring a niche that exists. Sometimes you wonder what a designer is thinking, that they're exploring something that no one wants, but not in this case. People will want what Medium does. 	Now to the bullet points.	1. It's a hybrid, at the intersection of blogging systems and commenting systems. 	2. You don't have to create a blog. This can be a huge barrier for some people. People who have something to say but view creating a blog as making a commitment. Technically they're not right about this. Creating a new blog is no more complex than creating a new word processing document. But there's a psychic overhead that stops a lot of people. I know this because I've been evangelizing blogs for many years. A lot of people feel this commitment and it stops them from contributing.	3. Like Twitter, this product is a simplification of what came before, a narrowing, and a focusing, but it's still wide open. Zeldman kind of got tripped up by this, but Williams was very clear. Users can create new buckets or collections and call them anything they want. A bucket is analogous to a blog post. Then other people can post to it. That's like a comment. But it doesn't look like a comment. It's got a place for a big image at the top. It looks much prettier than a comment, and much bigger. Looks are important here. 	4. There's no way for a user to control CSS or provide a template, or even choose a template from a library. This would make the product more complex. Not sure what their plans are here, but whether they offer these features will play a big role in defining the service.	5. It's closest to Tumblr right now -- another product that occupies the space between full-blown blogging like WordPress, and ultra lightweight blogging in Twitter. Clearly Twitter is moving more towards Tumblr. If Medium adds templates and CSS they will be aimed squarely at Tumblr. 	&amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ford+model+t&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sa-uULz-KcXd0QHT_YCoCQ&amp;ved=0CAQQ_AUoAA&amp;biw=1185&amp;bih=1109">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/22/oldFord.gif" width="165" height="91" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named oldFord.gif">&amp;lt;/a>6. Also not clear is how much portability users will have. At this point they offer beta users a way to download the contents of their site. This doesn't make it possible to use it as an editorial system for other environments, or the other way around, to use other tools to author content for Medium. There's no doubt Ev understands the opportunities here. Blogger had a pretty complete API as did Twitter. But in Twitter, everyone got burned by the API, including the company (though to a much lesser extent than developers) so my guess is that Ev's new company will be more conservative about interfaces than his previous ventures.	7. The editor has some nice touches. The biggest one being that the rendering styles apply in when you're editing, so it delivers a level of &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG&amp;lt;/a> that previously I had not seen in browser-based editors. This will be a highly valued feature. This is the sizzle of Medium, along with the very easy to read template they use. 	8. The more I understand about Medium, the more trouble I have seeing how it co-exists with another Williams startup, Branch. It seems like they're both camped out in the same space betw blogging and Twitter. That as the two products evolve they will keep colliding with each other. 	9. They just hired a &amp;lt;a href="https://medium.com/about/4459985d253a">Director of Content&amp;lt;/a>, a former agent in the book publishing industry. Very curious. I guess that means famous authors will submit chapters from upcoming books and allow regular folk to attach our own writing to this stuff. Analogous to getting Oprah on Twitter? That could give Medium a very short honeymoon with the early adopters that make these kinds of services grow. 	10. This is yet another company that compensates its employees without compensating the content creators. Although clearly there is a class of creators who may receive compensation (see the previous point). Personal comment -- this makes me reluctant to participate. I appreciate getting early access, and I have posted a few items to the service to better understand how it works. But without a fair balance between the valuation of all of our contributions, I can't continue, or recommend that others contribute. I've always been on the outside of Ev's creations, putting creativity in while he and others take the dollars out. It's fun for a while, but then it gets old. The Internet and the web weren't designed this way, and I keep waiting for one of these services to build something that doesn't have this very tilted posture. That would be harder, but much more significant. 	11. Maybe the biggest point he makes in the podcast is his view that Medium should be seen as if it were YouTube for writing. We all understand what YouTube is. Is YouTube-for-Writing a niche? Not sure. Video obviously has special needs regarding bandwidth. And those issues don't exist for text. But aggregating them all in one spot has advantages. But it's possible to do that without capturing all of it one company's servers.Why I quit Netflix	Last week I turned off my Netflix account. 	I have had it for at least a decade, paying between $9 and $21 a month.	I turned it off because I stopped using it. The last thing I watched on Netflix was Ken Burns' series The West. But I found I could get that on Amazon's video service, for no extra money, since I was already an Amazon Prime member.	But even before I was using Amazon, I was hardly ever using Netflix.	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/24/netflixdvd.gif" width="110" height="70" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named netflixdvd.gif">Netflix was a great way for me to fill in a lot of the blanks in my movie-watching career. I missed a lot of great movies in the last couple of decades, while I was busy with other things. And there were all the movies made before I was born that I had of course missed. With Netflix, I pretty much could always find something I hadn't seen that was worth seeing. And I could systematically march through whole genres. It was like &amp;lt;a href="http://www.tcm.com/">TCM&amp;lt;/a> on steroids. 	But then two things happened: 1. I caught up and 2. They closed the DVD side of the business, or if they didn't close it, they discouraged it. I forget how I came not to be a subscriber to the DVDs. But the on-demand service just wasn't worth it to me. There wasn't enough stuff to watch, or if it was there, I didn't know how to find it. 	I think Netflix missed the &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/07/30/attentionMashups.html">boat&amp;lt;/a>, bigtime. They could have been the place on the net to learn about and watch and share movie experiences. I think they could have started a match.com type service. If you're in a strange city and would like to go to the movies with someone with similar tastes, just click a few buttons. They were gathering all this information about people's movie preferences. But they were reluctant to build systems around it. And reluctant to open it up to app developers. I think we all missed out on something, because movies at least to some of us are such an important form of personal expression.	These days there's hardly any time for catching up on old movies. My life is filled with all kinds of entertainment, I never have a chance to see it all. Netflix played a big role in the early days by giving us access to a huge base of old movies that are worth seeing. Now it's time for something new. Maybe someone else will try to fill the gap that Netflix never wanted to fill. Jeremy Lin and the small picture	Of course I watched the Houston Rockets play the New York Knicks last night, and I felt the way I felt on Election Day, that if the result wasn't what I hoped it would be that I wouldn't be able to face life. Luckily, both events had favorable outcomes. Both Obama and the Rockets &amp;lt;a href="http://blog.chron.com/ultimaterockets/2012/11/hot-shooting-by-the-rockets-cools-off-the-hot-knicks/">won&amp;lt;/a>, decisively. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/24/linAndHarding.jpg" width="145" height="112" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named linAndHarding.jpg">The Knicks protested that it was just another game and that they weren't even thinking of Jeremy Lin, the miracle that landed by accident in New York last year, the perfect player for the next decade of basketball. Esp in NYC where the Chinese-American community is rapidly growing. And in China, which loves basketball, they must be wondering why they moved Lin from New York to Houston. I believe we could have found an extra $50 million in an economy that has apartments that sell for $100 million (they are nice apartments). 		I grew up in Flushing, which then was a mostly Catholic, Irish and Italian neighborhood. Now it's &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=flushing+chinatown&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SfSwUL7WDsrn0gGzl4DwDg&amp;ved=0CFEQsAQ">largely&amp;lt;/a> Chinese. I went out to eat with my mom at a restaurant on &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Main+Street+and+Roosevelt+Ave,+Flushing,+NY&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=40.765808,-73.833084&amp;sspn=0.065592,0.069008&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=Main+St+%26+Roosevelt+Ave,+Queens,+New+York+11354&amp;t=m&amp;z=17">Main Street&amp;lt;/a> a couple of years ago, and they asked if we were tourists (presumably because we were white). We laughed and said no, we're natives. :-)	But the Knicks obviously &amp;lt;i>were&amp;lt;/i> focused on Lin last night, at least at the beginning, and unfortunately for New York, Houston had three other players ready to go -- James Harden, Chandler Parsons and Omer Asik. All of them very young, and they kept their cool, while the veterans on the Knicks melted down. I expected it from Carmelo Anthony, but was surprised to see Tyson Chandler lose his cool (and they should have taken him out of the game after he elbowed Rocket Omer Asik in the throat, in anger). 	And there were some dazzling Linsane plays to remind us how good this young man is. 	The Houston team is made largely of reallly good young players who were on the benches of their former teams. They are the youngest team in the NBA. It's wonderful to see them playing with such enthusiasm, excellence and composure. In every way they remind one of the Knicks in the brief period of Linsanity. This is the team the Knicks could have had,  now they're playing in Houston. I would swap the roster of the Rockets for the Knicks team any day. 	I don't think either team is going to win this year -- but I don't go for sports to see my team win. What I love is a group of highly talented people helping each other to create something bigger than any one of them. That's why I despise what the Knicks are, a team that wins or loses based on the performance of a single player. 	Watching the Rockets move the ball around the court, kind of daring the Knicks to figure out who was going to take the shot or the layup, was pure poetry. The kind of poetry that the Knicks were doing so well when Lin was our point guard. 	I think basketball has changed, and last night's game was a perfect demo. I don't expect many of the sports writers to cover it. I think their assignment was to "prove" that Linsanity either: 1. Didn't happen or 2. Was just a fluke. And 3. That basketball was always and will always be about superstars and individual performances. 	It's the same kind of thinking that leads you to believe that politics is about the bosses listening to the people to figure out what to say to get their votes. If that's how politics worked, marijuana and gay marriage would not have been legalized, and Mitt Romney would have won Ohio, if not the Presidency. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/24/smallpicture.gif" width="55" height="83" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named smallpicture.gif">&amp;lt;/a>We are riding a sea change in communication technology. It's been going on for 30 to 40 years. The people who grew up in the new world are maturing and taking power. It's not a centralized system any more. The owners and most of the players in the NBA want Linsanity to go away. Jeremy Lin and James Harden are symbols of what can happen if the individual says he or she is not buying into the system. I don't know about most of the fans, but this fan is fed up with the idea of a super-human superstar. I want teamwork and joy, and love enough for everyone. Humility and fun. 	In the past it was the big picture that mattered. Today, and more so in the future, it's what individuals choose or want, the small picture, that matters.The new Camp David accord	Everything was in balance between Israel and Egypt until &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mubarak_era">Mubarak&amp;lt;/a> was overthrown in a popular uprising early last year. The US continued to give &amp;lt;a href="http://www.propublica.org/blog/item/f.a.q.-on-u.s.-aid-to-egypt-where-does-the-money-go-who-decides-how-spent">aid&amp;lt;/a> to the Egyptian military, but weren't sure if the deal was still in place after the change in government. 	The deal, to be clear, was the US gives money to Egypt and the army supports peace with Israel and the people of Egypt are suppressed. 	The Israelis desperately wanted to verify that the old deal was still in place. They couldn't test it without some kind of conflict. So they created one. Now we need a cease fire. Secretary Clinton flies to Cairo. Drama. Does the old deal stand? she asks. &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Morsi">Morsi&amp;lt;/a> asks to have the deal explained. She does. He says sounds good. She asks for proof. What would you like? Announce that you are taking extra-constitutional power. He asks if the money will keep flowing. She says yes. He says OK.	That's what I think &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/world/middleeast/egypts-president-morsi-gives-himself-new-powers.html?pagewanted=all">happened&amp;lt;/a>. 	PS: Why would Israel want to know now whether the peace deal with Egypt was still in place? Maybe they're getting ready to attack Iran and want to be sure they don't have to fight Egypt too.Two best movies of 2012	The best movies of the year are slotted-in at the end, but sometimes movies that are released earlier in the year are also great, but sometimes slip under the radar, so a lot of people don't see them.	My two favorite so far for 2012 are like that -- Paranorman and Savages. I knew to see them because both were born of movies that I adored in the past. 	Paranorman was created by the same animation studio that did Coraline. 	And Savages is classic Oliver Stone. One of my &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/myFavoriteMovies">favorite movies&amp;lt;/a> of all time, Any Given Sunday, not a famous movie, is an Oliver Stone classic. 	&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OtBlbStz6kQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NIPpdEjORas" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	I believe both Paranorman and Savages are available in DVD now. They are great movies, the best so far in 2012, according to this reviewer.How I ran ThinkTank/1987 in Chrome	A really interesting combination of technologies, old and new...	1. An app written in JavaScript running embedded in a &amp;lt;a href="http://jsmachines.net/">web page&amp;lt;/a>, viewed in Chrome. 	2. Running on a Mac with 2GB of RAM and four terabytes of disk storage.	3. That emulates an &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer">IBM PC&amp;lt;/a> running the original ROM BIOS. 	All this was put together by &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jeffpar">Jeff Par&amp;lt;/a>, whose blog is &amp;lt;a href="http://hashable.org/">hashable.org&amp;lt;/a>.	I heard about it from &amp;lt;a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/2012_11_18.htm#jsvc">Dan Bricklin&amp;lt;/a>, who along with Bob Frankston, wrote &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc">Visicalc&amp;lt;/a>. I've known both these guys since 1979 believe it or not. Somehow they had gotten Visicalc to run in this emulator. I nearly shit my pants when I saw it.	&amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ford+model+t&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sa-uULz-KcXd0QHT_YCoCQ&amp;ved=0CAQQ_AUoAA&amp;biw=1185&amp;bih=1109">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/22/oldFord.gif" width="165" height="91" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named oldFord.gif">&amp;lt;/a>Of course I knew how to use Visicalc then and still do. I was able to put together a simple spreadsheet. It worked.	Then of course I wondered if &amp;lt;a href="http://outliners.scripting.com/thinkTank2Pc.html">ThinkTank&amp;lt;/a> from that era would work. So I contacted Jeff, asked if he would be interested in trying it. I uploaded a Thinktank disk image to a folder on Amazon S3, then put together a list of files in the &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/22/myOutliner.gif">outliner&amp;lt;/a> I use in 2012, and saved it as a &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/thinktank241np1987">blog post&amp;lt;/a> on scripting.com.	He took the files, did something magical with them, and now there's a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/22/menu.gif">menu item&amp;lt;/a> on his &amp;lt;a href="http://jsmachines.net/">emulator page&amp;lt;/a> that offers to load an image of that disk into this virtual PC. So I fiddled with the commands a bit, &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/22/tt1987.gif">got it to run&amp;lt;/a>. There was a little difficulty in getting the F10 function key to go to the browser, since some Apple system software was grabbing it. That was easily done in the keyboard section of the system settings app on the Mac. 	I have a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/22/refcard.jpg">ref card&amp;lt;/a> of the commands in ThinkTank, but I didn't need them, because I still remember how it worked. I slaved over this UI many years ago. It would be &amp;lt;i>hard&amp;lt;/i> for me to forget how to do this. 	Dan asked if I would do a video showing how it works. I will (and will link it in here). I imagine that years from now people will watch the video even if the emulator doesn't still run. Maybe it will. Back then I kind of hoped it would be possible to run this sofware 25 years later. What a thrill that it turns out it does, and in such a widely accessible way.	If you're studying the evolution of user interface, being able to look at this time capsule could be pretty useful. This software running on 1980s hardware, is interesting in the same way it would be interesting to drive a &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_automobile">car&amp;lt;/a> from the early 20th century. You can see ideas that would later take hold and blossom once machines had more capacity and could be easily networked, and we better understood how people work with the new technology.

href="http://allthingsd.com/20121120/reed-hastings-on-microsoft-watch-windows-8-not-surface/">This piece&amp;lt;/a> has an extensive quote from Reed Hastings as a departing Microsoft board member about Microsoft's thinking behind the odd way Windows 8 is organized. 	They think there's a transition to touch taking place that's analogous to the transition to the mouse in the 80s and 90s. So they're putting the windows part of Windows into a compatibility box, the way they put DOS inside a window on Windows. You can still get to your Windows apps, but they're betting you will prefer to use the touch-based apps. That don't yet exist. But will soon. That's their bet. 	My opinion: Wow. Why bet the company's user base and cash cow on that when they could just switch to Mac, as I'm sure a lot of them already want to, and get a "traditional" desktop. 	Apple has been edging up to the same idea, in a much more conservative and rational way, imho. Testing the theory before betting what is &amp;lt;i>not&amp;lt;/i> their biggest revenue source (Apple is now a devices company, iPad and iPhones make up most of their revenue). If Apple is being conservative, Ballmer thinks, I'll make the big bet. And hope I'm not wrong.	Problem is this -- desktop computers as touch devices is not a new idea. &amp;lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/personalsystems/0031/">HP's first PC&amp;lt;/a>, in 1983, was touch-based. It failed. Not because there was no software, there was. The reason is that it's really painful to hold up your arm and touch the screen as a way of controlling the computer when the screen is vertical, not horizontal. The keyboard won.	Touch belongs in a tablet interface, for sure. But desktop computers need a pointing device like a mouse. I think Apple realizes that now, and isn't pushing the Mac in that direction. But this appears to be a bet-the-cash-cow move for Microsoft. Let's hope they have a Plan B ready to go!	See also: Jakob Nielsen's &amp;lt;a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/windows-8.html">report&amp;lt;/a> on Windows 8.Adjectives for Mitt Romney	1.

Both have gotten some great responses.		An aside, one reason the comments might be more lively is that I went to &amp;lt;a href="http://www.avc.com/">Fred Wilson's blog&amp;lt;/a> and noted that his Disqus threads were much longer and easier to read than mine. I went to the setup page for Disqus and found some prefs I didn't know were there, and found an ability to add styles to their CSS, and voila -- much nicer!	In a &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/tvNewsIsBullshit#comment-713407966">comment&amp;lt;/a> on the first post, Kristopher Nelson, a PhD student and former software dev, said he didn't disagree with my points, but had trouble turning them into practical actions he can actually do, instead of relying on "installed leaders" to kick it of for him (paraphrasing).	He's right! I said what the problems are, but I didn't offer ways to help. This is equally important. So here's a list of things you can do to help.		1. Don't write mini-essays in Twitter. Instead fully express your idea on your blog and post a link to Twitter. That's the single most constructive thing people can do. 		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/20/lego.gif" width="125" height="144" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named lego.gif">2. If you absolutely can't respond in a post, then respond in a comment. 140 character posts are very often impossible to parse. And are hard to respond to if my answer requires more than 140. That's why I don't do support on Twitter. I think it's impossible. And tweets have limited utility after they scroll off. Comments create a somewhat better record. And instead of concentrating everything on one company's servers, we can spread them around a little.			That said, don't see this rule as requiring you to be long-winded. You still want to get to the point quickly so people read what you're saying. People are very busy these days, so you want to say what you have to say as quickly as possible. And if you have a blogging tool that supports collapsable text like mine, use it to add detail in a way that's optional for the reader. 		3. For the installed leaders -- run a river of the blogs you read, and share it with your readers. Link to it prominently from your home page. Talk about it in posts. Get people to read more than just your blog. 			Someone asked for an example of a river. &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave">Here you go&amp;lt;/a>. 			A river is the next thing after a blogroll.			A blogroll just has pointers to blogs. A river includes their stories.			It's a way of defining a community. It's one of those wonderful things that empowers the river-owner and the people whose content flows through the river. 			Someday not only will every publication have a river, but they will be defined by their river. 			We need to get one editorial organization to do it and do it right.			BTW, people note that my river is mostly mainstream pubs. That's because bloggers are publishing so little these days. I subscribe to lots of blogs. But they aren't updating. Let's fix that!		4. Also do the thing that the "big boys" do so well -- reference each other. If I write something that you find interesting, write a blog post about it, and link to my post. 		5. Don't wait for a press release to write about something that's new. I find it amazing sometimes all the new stuff I've shipped on Scripting News, whci now is a fairly radical-looking blog with at least a few never-seen-before features, yet, as far as I know -- no one has written about them. Why? They say that news is just regurgitated press releases. This seems to confirm it.		6. Fight conventional wisdom. One of the reasons blogs started in the first place was to fight the CW that there was no new Mac software. All the reporters knew this wasn't true, but they reported the CW that there wasn't. Reporters still do this. So let's route around that. The great &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Nisker">Scoop Nisker&amp;lt;/a> said -- If you don't like the news, go out and make some of your own. A very wise man. :-)		7. Share your ideas and observations. Start new threads that aren't responsive to anyone else. If you have an epiphany or see something you don't think anyone else has seen -- that's a blog post. Write it up!		8. If you're a developer, hook your favorite tweet-like system up to RSS, both ways. I want to be able to hook my &amp;lt;a href="http://links.scripting.com/rss.xml">linkblog feed&amp;lt;/a> up to everything. This is how we bootstrap a network of compatible twitter-like systems. Use an existing standard that's &amp;lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/magazine/17-09/ff_goodenough?currentPage=all">good enough&amp;lt;/a> to hook everything up to everything. This way we can have competiing visions for how this stuff works, and still have content flow easily across systems. 	One more motto, a variant of something President Kennedy said. &amp;lt;i>Ask not what the Internet can do for you, ask what you can do for the Internet.&amp;lt;/i> These days so many people look to the Internet to make them rich or famous or powerful. So much so that the poor Internet is exhausted from all those people taking from it. Think about what you can put back that may not help just you, that may help the Internet itself. It's important. I hope Mark Cuban reads this	Hey Mark, I read your &amp;lt;a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2012/11/19/what-i-really-think-about-facebook/">piece&amp;lt;/a> about Facebook, and think you're right about one thing and wrong about another.	1. You're right to be appalled that Facebook does not show your updates to all your followers. They are breaking a trust. You promoted Facebook to your customers for free, and not only don't they reciprocate -- by finding you new followers -- they don't even fulfill their side of the deal, by showing your updates to the people who signed up for them.		Yes, I know Facebook disclaims this. But we all thought that updates went to all followers, before discovering the hard way, that they didn't. Cuban is a smart guy. If he was surprised by this, imagine how surprised the less-savvy execs at other companies are going to be. 	2. However, your response, to diversify to other social networks is wrong. Why would you think they would do it any differently than Facebook? What have they agreed to do for you in return? If you're just using their normal TOS, they're agreeing to do &amp;lt;i>nothing&amp;lt;/i> for you.	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/19/webIsDead.gif" width="150" height="116" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named webIsDead.gif">Last night I was watching football on one of the big networks. It was a boring game so my mind drifted. I noticed that when they show the name of someone speaking on camera they also show their Twitter handle. I wondered if their lawyers had reviewed this decision. Had they read Twitter's user agreement? Had they advised their client on how one-sided it is? That made me wonder if Twitter does special deals with big media conglomerates? I wonder what they look like? I follow Twitter pretty closely and I have no idea.	Back to Mark -- hope you're still reading.	You're so smart about tech, why are you so dumb about this!	&amp;lt;i>We need to use the Internet itself as social media.&amp;lt;/i> Then you won't have to worry about Facebook putting their finger on the scale. Let's create the software you need to license. You can run it on your own servers, or let's start a company to run the service for media companies like the Dallas Mavericks and the NBA. Being at the mercy of tech startups like this is not smart. They are not your friends, or even good business partners.	Update: Mark Cuban did read this, and &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/iHopeMarcCubanReadsThis#comment-713819640">responded&amp;lt;/a>. Our news predicament	Back in the 90s I thought blogs would be the antidote to the bullshit of news, but it didn't turn out that way. Here's what happened.		1. The early bloggers did deals with investors, so they needed revenue. 		2. Mostly they become marketing channels for the companies. For example, I like Om Malik, but the only stories GigaOm covers are ones from big companies and startups with VC money. Om is a nice guy and all the people who work for him are nice people. They also have jobs to do. If you look at his conferences they are marketing events for the people who speak. That leads to a certain type of discussion, and ignores a lot of other things that require thought and discourse. Same with O'Reilly, TechCrunch, etc etc. You can't blame a shark for being a meat-eater. But you shouldn't think they're anything other than that.			How do I know how this works? Because as a company CEO I have participated in it, and if I'm ever a CEO again I will once again participate. So obviously I don't think it's bad. But let's not think we're getting our daily dose of tech news this way. What we're getting is marketing. 		2a. It's not just tech. TPM, Redstate, Politico, Buzzfeed, Huffington etc, don't stray off the accepted path, or the market won't know what to do with them. The product they sell? Campaigns, the ability to shift public opinion so more government money ends up in your bank account, or your taxes stay low, or you're allowed to warm the earth for free, sell arms to bad govts, keep the UN out of your country, etc. Again, I'm not going to question the value of what they do, only to say what we need to do is much bigger than what they do. 			And music journalism supports the music industry.			Sports journalism supports the NBA, NFL, MLB, Olympics, NCAA, etc.		3. Plan B was that user/bloggers would review the companies' products, and we'd at least get non-bullshit product news that way. That worked for a while, then people started using Twitter, and have been reduced to 140-character grunts and snorts. You can tell a little truth in 140-character chunks. Very little ones. Nothing factually interesting. For that you need a little elbow room. If that's really going to happen, more people have to write blog posts. 		4. There are a few product-oriented blogs out there. But not enough for critical mass. Some of them make money, some even a lot. But there isn't enough to read to cover most of what I'm interested in, and also the stuff I don't know I'm interested in. If we could do more networking on a more regular and systematic basis, that would create incentives for more people to do it, and would build flow independent of Twitter. But blogs work like everything else. Installed leaders don't generally help upstarts. Might impact the bottom-line. Go back to the sharks analogy. It takes some big thinking and betting to see that we're going to starve outside Twitter soon, and we'd all do better if we invest in each other and in opening doors for newcomers. We're playing out the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">prisoners dilemma&amp;lt;/a>, as we always do.	I still think there's a way out of it. But it means that bloggers have to do more cooperating than they're likely to want to do. Believe me, I'm an expert in how hard it is to get bloggers to cooperate. I always have a bunch of propositions for them. Only a very few of them have even been seriously considered, much less adopted. Usually that happens when I give them my flow to get them to do something.	I'm into level playing fields. There isn't one now. We're in really bad shape in terms of news distribution. And it's going to get worse.	We're always in the predicament Benjamin Franklin described at the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. "We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately." If we could get past that we could start really reinventing news. Now. Where is maps.apple.com?	&amp;lt;a href="http://maps.apple.com/">Apparently&amp;lt;/a> there is no way to access an Apple map from a desktop computer.	I'd love to try pointing to an Apple map from a blog post, so we could do a realistic A-B comparison with &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/">Google maps&amp;lt;/a>, which of course can be accessed from anywhere from a web browser.	Pet peeve: Google Maps may have a serious problem with embedding. When I embed a bit of a map in a blog post it loses its position. For example, if you expand this headline you'll see a map of Bandley Drive in Cupertino. (If you scroll around you'll find it.)		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/18/frack.gif" width="153" height="61" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 40px; padding-right: 75px;" alt="A picture named where.gif">&amp;lt;iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bandley+Drive,+Cupertino,+CA&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Bandley+Dr,+Cupertino,+California+95014&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;ll=37.327513,-122.034436&amp;amp;output=embed">&amp;lt;/iframe>&amp;lt;br />&amp;lt;small>&amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bandley+Drive,+Cupertino,+CA&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Bandley+Dr,+Cupertino,+California+95014&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;ll=37.327513,-122.034436&amp;amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">View Larger Map&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;/small>	That might seem like a small thing, but I'm kind of a perfectionist. I insist on having my maps actually show the place I'm trying to show you. :-)	Anyway -- it would be great to be able to try Apple Maps on my Mac or even a Google phone! 	Update: Turns out that &amp;lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/22/mapsception/">Apple maps redirect to Google&amp;lt;/a> on the desktop. The Apple of Steve's Eye	Last week I wrote a one-week &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/steveWouldntHaveShippedTheIpadMini">review&amp;lt;/a> of the iPad Mini. And said that I was thinking of selling my Apple stock. Update: I still have both the Mini and the stock. 	I got a lot of grief because of the piece. I've come to expect that. Seriously, Apple zealots might want to &amp;lt;i>someday&amp;lt;/i> tone it down a little. This has been going on a long time. For such an elegant company, it sure attracts some inelegant fans. 	I said what I think, and since it's a blog post, no one will think it's a final judgment, allowing no disagreement. Maybe the judgers are the kinds of people who leave no room for other people's opinions. They must think I am like them. I am not. I thrive on different opinions, because I learn from them. I'm truly interested in knowing what other people think, as long as its respectful.	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/17/jobs.gif" width="145" height="145" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named jobs.gif">For example, I love talking about movies with my friend &amp;lt;a href="http://nakedjen.blogs.com/">NakedJen&amp;lt;/a>, because she so totally loves movies, but the ones she loves are different from the ones I love. We've seen a lot of movies together, and I don't recall us ever coming out of the theater both in love. She tends to like movies I that I find boring or trite. But I always look forward to talking with her, because I like viewing things through her eyes. In that way I like almost everyone -- if an idea is well-expressed, it doesn't matter whether I agree or disagree. I love human expression. I really don't care so much about whether they're right or wrong. And in the case of how one person feels about a product or a movie, they just can't be wrong. They can't miss the mark, as long as they try to say what they see and what they think. And don't pretend it's anything more than that. I sure don't think my opinion is more than that. 	I love products. I especially love products that hit the mark perfectly. Of course I've never seen one. But some products come pretty close! And I've even had a couple myself that hit the mark squarely, and of course not perfectly. When I make a new product, that's what I try to do.		It's not just products I love, but strategies.		In baseball, you can look at an individual pitch, and see how perfect it is, but then look at it as part of an at-bat, or an inning, a game, a season, career. 		Every act can be looked at in a lot of contexts. 		It's possible for the iPad Mini to be a perfect product for one person, or everyone -- at one time. But it also exists in a sequence of products. 		There are a lot of variables a strategist gets to tweak. And one of them is when to play the hand. You could keep accumulating cards for the perfect moment, and then wham lay them down. As Steve would say -- Boom. 		Sports, and theater, hardware and system software. It's all fun to put together and think about in a lot of different ways from all angles.	When I saw my first Mac, it actually spoke to me. No kidding! It wasn't like I walked into a room and knew there would be a Mac there. I saw it in a random office from a hallway on &amp;lt;a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/#tt=&amp;q=Bandley+Dr%2C+Cupertino%2C+CA+95014&amp;conf=1&amp;start=1&amp;lat=37.327511&amp;lon=-122.034332&amp;zoom=16&amp;mvt=m&amp;trf=0">Bandley Drive&amp;lt;/a> in 1983, while it was still a secret project. I saw it out of the corner of my eye, and instantly and viscerally I knew it was going to consume a big part of my life. I knew it was the machine I wanted to make software for. All in an instant. I'd say that was about as close to "hitting the mark" as any product I've ever seen. Even though it was a famously flawed product. 		&amp;lt;iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=bandley+drive,+cupertino&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Bandley+Dr,+Cupertino,+California+95014&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;iwloc=A&amp;amp;output=embed">&amp;lt;/iframe>&amp;lt;br />&amp;lt;small>&amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=bandley+drive,+cupertino&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Bandley+Dr,+Cupertino,+California+95014&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;iwloc=A&amp;amp;source=embed" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">View Larger Map&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;/small>	So when Marco &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/268197095880663040">says&amp;lt;/a> I was far from the mark with my piece, that made me stop and think.  He could be right, but we won't know for a while.		&amp;lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&amp;lt;p>Dave Winer is often right on the mark, but this is pretty far from it. &amp;lt;a href="http://t.co/NyDJJxyG" title="http://gizmodo.com/5959770/is-the-ipad-mini-the-beginning-of-apples-decline">gizmodo.com/5959770/is-the&amp;#138;&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Marco Arment (@marcoarment) &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/268197095880663040" data-datetime="2012-11-13T03:42:25+00:00">November 13, 2012&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;/blockquote>		&amp;lt;script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&amp;lt;/script>	Let's think about it this way, how might Apple have approached this, assuming what so many people think is true, that in a year or two, they won't be limited to the current low resolution screen. Let's assume for the sake of argument that there's an 80 percent probability that in 2015 we'd be able to ship the absolutely killer product, one that makes you scream it's so cool. Never mind what it means to the users, of course that's important to you and me, but that's not how the Apple of Steve's Eye made its decisions. &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html">Doc Searls wrote&amp;lt;/a> about this in 1997, and talk about hitting the mark. Dead bull's eye for Doc. You want to understand Steve's Apple -- read that piece. 	Remember when netbooks were the rage? I kept saying Apple should ship one. And Apple kept saying we'll ship one when we're ready. The ones everyone is selling aren't good enough for us to put Apple's name on it. I think Cook even said they were junk. I thought that was extreme, but I respected the drama of it. That's some kind of confidence. So we waited. And what came? The iPad. I still wish they had shipped something that worked like the netbooks of the day, but they didn't. Apple wouldn't compromise. It took guts and vision and certainty, patience, and an absolute desire to hit the ball out of the park in a historic way. It would have been a lot easier to just ship something like a netbook. Just as it's easier to ship a compromise like the current iPad Mini. 	I also mentioned a change in the way I was thinking about my Apple stock. I felt that's part of the deal of writing a blog, when I write about companies I own stock in. If I'm thinking about selling, I have to say that, unless there's a really good reason not to. I put it at the top, at the beginning, so it would stand out. Because when I tell my readers that I bought the stock, and then tell them that I hold it, if one day I tell them I sold it, I'd like to have told them inbetween that I was thinking of selling it. It seems to me the honest thing to do. After all I didn't buy an ad and say this to random people as some kind of great proclamation. I wrote a blog post, on my blog, to people who read my blog, and said "I'm thinking of selling my stock, and here's why."	But the main point was to put a little stake in the ground, so a couple of years from now I could go back and see what I thought about this product when I first got it. My blog has lots of posts like that, and it helps me as a person who is into products and has changing tastes, and makes mistakes, and learns new stuff along the way. 	"cheesecake"Google Reader communities	I had a phone conversation today with a reporter doing a story on Google Reader communities.	Apparently there was an active social network built around Google Reader that disbanded when Google tried to switch everyone over to Google Plus. This is something I didn't know about, except peripherally, because I never used Google Reader. I would like to learn more. (But have no interest in using Google Reader or Google Plus.)	Wondering if there are any opportunities for open development to help bring the communities back together, with the understanding that this time they will have to take responsibility for running the servers, and may have to pay for some of the software development.	This is a story that repeats in technology. I'm interested in trying to build sustained communities that don't depend on the continued investment of a single company. How tech companies grow	Two really interesting posts esp when juxtaposed.	1. Marco Arment writes &amp;lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/11/16/twitter-being-a-dick-again">about&amp;lt;/a> Twitter's limits on developers. "Even though we don't currently have a Windows 8 client, we might have one in the future, so yours isn't allowed," he paraphrases on Twitter's behalf.	2. Bijan Sabet, an early investor in Twitter, &amp;lt;a href="http://bijansabet.com/post/35849228202/the-first-photo-the-twitter-team-prior-to-our">posts&amp;lt;/a> two pictures. One when the company had 15 employees and a wide-open API. That was just four years ago. And the picture from today, when the company has 1500 employees and doesn't allow developers to compete with them.		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/16/twitterWith15.png" width="500" height="376" border="0" alt="A picture named twitterWith15.png">		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/16/twitterWith1500.jpg" width="500" height="375" border="0" alt="A picture named twitterWith1500.jpg">	Now I don't know for sure why Twitter changed their policies, but I can take a guess. 	Those 1500 employees have to &amp;lt;i>do&amp;lt;/i> something. At least some of them are going to write the clients that the developers used to write.	Which raises the next question. Why does the company need to hire all those people to work for money and stock when the developers are willing to do it for love? When you have the answer, you'll understand why Microsoft has shipped so many new versions of Windows over the last ten years, when the market was perfectly happy with the version they produced ten years ago. 	Spoiler: All those employees make decisions that tend to keep them employed. That's how small innovative companies become big incumbent ones. What is going on in Gaza?	I saw the initial messages on Twitter from the IDF yesterday and a flutter of other messages from people apparently on the other side.	News reports tell of the action, bombs and rockets, and what may come next. 	I read Jessica Roy's &amp;lt;a href="http://betabeat.com/2012/11/social-media-companies-have-absolutely-no-idea-how-to-handle-the-gaza-conflict/">excellent piece&amp;lt;/a> saying social media companies had no idea what to do. A war is being fought on the networks. This was inevitable, but now it's actually happening. 	Maybe that's all there is to say. But it's very much a fog from my desk here in NYC.	If you can shed any light without turning &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/whatIsGoingOnInGaza">my site&amp;lt;/a> into a war zone, please do. 	Here are some links I'm finding.		&amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffersonObama/status/269446850971570178">Jeff Gauvin&amp;lt;/a>: "Bibi launches a war on Gaza to win an election."Linkblog via email	I learned how to use &amp;lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT&amp;lt;/a> today, thanks to a recommendation from &amp;lt;a href="http://laughingsquid.com/">Laughing Squid&amp;lt;/a> man, &amp;lt;a href="http://scottbeale.org/">Scott Beale&amp;lt;/a>.

Let me just say that the tastes of their users and mine are not the same. I'd much rather eat food from NYMag-recommended restaurants. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/15/coffeeMugWhite.gif" width="145" height="136" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named coffeeMugWhite.gif">So could we please have a melding of good criticism and a great commerce website? Integration would be fantastic, not only with restaurants but with movie listings. I like to use &amp;lt;a href="http://www.google.com/movies">movies.google.com&amp;lt;/a>.

For that I go to the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/movies/index.html">NY Times&amp;lt;/a>, mostly. I'm learning to use other sources now that I have a &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=movies">movies river&amp;lt;/a>, thanks to NakedJen's recommendations of movie review sites, and an evening I spent browsing around a month ago. 	Hey why not hook in Amazon's recommendation engine.

It's a serious omission. Thanks. :-)Vivid dreams	Something switched over for me recently, wish I knew what it was -- but I'm not spending as much time writing code. Instead I'm writing blog posts and hanging out, reading and doing a lot of sleeping. And because there's been so much sleep there's been a lot of dreams. And sometimes I remember little bits of dreams that at the time I thought were interesting or profound. 	It seems significant when the narrator in my dream is my father. I wonder later if this is just my version of him inside me, or if there's some method of communication between the subconscious and the dead. 	Sometimes it freaks me out that people in my dream see things about me that I don't myself see, in the dream. How could this be, I wonder -- because the other people are really me. It's as if my subconscious has written a play that my conscious self knows nothing about.	And lately my dreams have had a long-gone lover in them, and we're re-living the agonizing last days of our relationship. I woke this morning with a real, sad, and unhappy question. What if this was the love of your life, and you didn't know it then.	We say "no regrets" so casuallly, but is life anything &amp;lt;i>but&amp;lt;/i> regrets?	And then I had a mathematical dream, wondering if time travel would be so entertaining to us if we hadn't invented awkward language for time that suggests that it could possibly be a two-direction thing. 	Stories about time travel are fun, probably because we live with so much with regret. What if there were the possibility of going back and doing it again, knowing what you know now. When you're young you don't even know what that idea means. It's not like life imparts all that much wisdom, no -- it's what you know about yourself that matters. This was the big one Dave. We know that now. Be more loving, more caring -- spend the time to avoid misunderstanding. Don't give up so easy. Or give up easier. Try something else because what you did the first time around didn't work. If only. If only life were like programming, where you could do it three or four times, each time learning from what you did wrong and choosing not to do it again. Or if I could travel back in time and have a talk with those two young people and find out what's really in their hearts. Force them together in an embrace so they can talk love instead of hurt.	It doesn't get any less confusing. But as you go forward things are done, they're finished. Books are closed and life goes on -- until it doesn't. 	I can still tell the stories about the people I miss, the loves of my life who are no more. The friends who are gone, the people who are just stories now, just actors in my dreams. 	Apparently I have more important work right now that writing new code. :-)Jeremy Lin belongs in Brooklyn	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/14/brooklyn.gif" width="145" height="127" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 5px;" alt="A picture named brooklyn.gif">For some reason it just feels right that Jeremy Lin should play for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association. 	The Knicks were too good for him, I guess -- but the Nets -- Brooklyn? Fugheddaboudit. It's poifect. Like Canarsie and Flatbush. The L train and the Q train. The Lawn Guyland Railroad and Junior's cheesecake. Prospect Park and Jeremy Lin. It works. 	Now, I want to say I don't know bupkis about the Nets except like the Knicks they have a couple of stars, and I'm sure the players wouldn't want Lin, but it would be reallllly smart business for the Nets to bring him back to NY where he is admired, and the Knicks are hated for letting him go. They can keep Carmelo and the rest, we want Jeremy Lin on the Nets. 	It would be so cool. And you'd get all the folks from &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Flushing">Flushing&amp;lt;/a>, and we'd come from Manhattan to see the Nets and when the Knicks play at Barclay we could yell in unison FUCK DA KNICKS and you wouldn't have to tell us to scream it louder. 	He's the new Jackie Robinson. He should be in Brooklyn. Please someone have the imagination to make this happen!!How did Cuban get caught?	Facebook, as far as I know, has &amp;lt;a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2007/07/16/inside-facebook-nfo-is-the-new-seo/">never&amp;lt;/a> showed all updates to all the people who follow you. 	There's always been an assumption that Twitter does show all your updates to all the people who follow you, but how could you know? It's really something only they know. My guess is that they don't either. It certainly would be consistent with all their past policies. 	We like to believe that our Internet services are like the Internet itself -- basically fair. But they are run by tech industry insiders, and they are not fair. Not even close. 	There was a time, not long ago, when Twitter dramatically inflated the follower counts of their personal friends, or press people they wanted good coverage from. Not by small amounts -- by hundreds of thousands of followers. Up till that point we sort of assumed they were trying to run a level playing field. It was at that point we learned they were not, in any way, trying to.	Here's a nightmare scenario for our friends in the media business, and these days almost everyone is in the media business, including Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA team.	1. More and more people depend on Twitter to show them the news. Other forms dry up. People stop going to home pages. Stop getting email alerts. Stop subscribing to RSS feeds. 	2. Big networks like CNN and NBC direct their viewers to follow them on Twitter. When NBC runs the Olympics, there's a Twitter icon on the screen a large percentage of the time. Twitter has become like a public thing, like the web. 	3. Twitter expands beyond the 140 character limit, for certain publications, at first they're liberal about who's included. And the first moves are small. Instead of a 140 character limit, there's now a 200 character limit. You can include a picture or a video, but not both. This is viewed without any ads on the Twitter site. More people don't bother going to the site to read the full story because they just wanted the synopsis anyway, or the picture. 	4. Now Twitter expands the limit beyond 200 characters. Full "long form" articles are now viewable directly on the Twitter site. They want to keep everyone on their site as much as possible. Now Mr or Ms Media Exec, what do you do? Do you go with them or not? But wait -- it gets better!	5. Off-site content gets a big warning about viruses and other malware. Be careful clicking on this link.	6. Twitter, Inc, now worth $85 billion, buys the Washington Post, NY Times and NBC News. 	7. You're not sure if they're showing your stories to your followers. You start to suspect that when the user clicks on your story they show them their version of the story. 	8. You threaten to pull all your content.	9. Twitter says okay. Don't slam the door on your way out.	I know this is just one scenario. It could turn out that Twitter is not a media company at all. They just look like one because I have a vivid imagination. You want to bet on that? Well, you &amp;lt;i>are&amp;lt;/i> betting on that. 	I think the media industry is as clued in on its future as Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan were about their chances at becoming the next President and Vice-President. I don't think Twitter is especially clever, they're just acting like a tech company. They're gradually encircling all the media entities and it seems the media guys don't have any idea it's happening. 	That's why &amp;lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2012/11/mark-cuban-wrong-on-facebook/">Cuban's exclamations&amp;lt;/a> about &amp;lt;a href="http://readwrite.com/2012/11/13/mark-cuban-facebooks-sponsored-posts-are-driving-away-brands">Facebook&amp;lt;/a> seem so naive. Did he not see this coming? Huh? He's supposed to be such a smart dude. How did he get caught in this trap? How did &amp;lt;i>you?&amp;lt;/i>	Other observations:		Twitter is not in any way "democratic" media. They amplify some voices, a lot. Not saying they cut back others, but they could and we wouldn't know. 		FYI -- there are no equivs of Mother Jones, Esquire, NY Mag in the tech world. It's all press releases and people gossip.		The political pundits are too occupied with mandates and sex to look around them and see how the media has changed. Spielberg's Lincoln	I saw &amp;lt;a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/movies/lincoln-by-steven-spielberg-stars-daniel-day-lewis.html?_r=0">Lincoln&amp;lt;/a> &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_(2012_film)">this&amp;lt;/a> afternoon. 	Good acting, esp of course Daniel Day-Lewis. 	Famous TV actors from &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Pryce">Mad Men&amp;lt;/a>, &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Breaking_Bad_characters#Gale_Boetticher">Breaking Bad&amp;lt;/a>, &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Van_Buren">Law &amp; Order&amp;lt;/a>. Surprising and fun to see them in 19th century costumes. 	Basically it's a shallow ho-hum Hollywood movie. No surprises. A plot that could be on any TV show, not even a very good one. 	There were a couple of decent jokes in there, esp one about George Washington. 	A movie that will be quickly forgotten, though it will probably win a few awards. 	Could have almost reviewed it in 140 characters, decided to write just a few more. :-)	Worth seeing, but not with a whole lot of enthusiasm.Generals Have Sex!	&amp;lt;i>Executive summary: It's safe to ignore what's happening in the news on TV.&amp;lt;/i>	I just tuned into MSNBC while I had lunch and caught the press conference with Jay Carney, White House spokesperson. The reporters want to know how the President feels about a general having sex. The logical, adult answer would be -- I don't really have an opinion about that. And that would be the end of it, because there's lots of sex going on all the time, and it isn't news. 	Right about now the press should be having the same soul-search the Repubs are having about why they were so surprised by the election. Why did they waste enormous hours "discussing" absolutely nothing in the time time leading up to the election. Instead, as if to prove they aren't doing anything, the big story is about a general's sex life.	PS: At some point in this "story" I expect Gary Tuchman or John King to get in front of one of those dazzling computer displays with an illustration of a penis and a vagina. They would then proceed to explain how it works. Then Alex Costellanos and David Gurgen could give the Republican view of sex, and Paul Begala could explain the Democratic view. Wolf Blitzer would proclaim it "very interesting."	PPS: Chuck Todd on MSNBC would show some numbers and Karl Rove on Fox would explain that Republicans don't have sex, so STFU.My iPad history	I have bought four iPads.	1. The first one was handed down to my mom, who loved it, so we bought her an iPad 3 with LTE. Then I gave the hand-me-down iPad to NakedJen in Salt Lake. I think she likes it too.		&amp;lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-in-reply-to="268026363708055553">&amp;lt;p>@&amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">davewiner&amp;lt;/a> I really do love my iPad. Very, very, much! I wasn't convinced I even needed one, now I take it everywhere! e&amp;&amp;lt;/p>&amp;mdash; nakedjen f' (@nakedjen) &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nakedjen/status/268090777920487424" data-datetime="2012-11-12T20:39:57+00:00">November 12, 2012&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;/blockquote>		&amp;lt;script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&amp;lt;/script>	2. I bought the iPad 2, which I still have. It's light and holds a charge for a long time, but it doesn't have LTE or a retina display. I keep it charged in the living room, and sometimes use it as a TV iPad. 	3. I bought an iPad 3 with LTE, which is getting the lion's share of use. As has been pointed out by many, I didn't like it when I first got it. I still don't like it for the reasons I stated then. It's heavy, runs hot, and doesn't hold a charge very long and takes a long time to charge. Managing its battery is a problem. Yet it's the one I travel with, and the one I read in bed, and often is the living room iPad, because of the beautiful screen and because of the LTE. For me the quality of the screen is important because I have impaired vision. This is not a theoretical thing, not something to brush aside. 	4. I have an iPad Mini, which to me seems a lot like the Kindle Fire I bought when it came out. I use it as little as I use the Kindle. Maybe that will change. Maybe not. When I got the iPad Mini, I put the Kindle on the coffee table too, so I could, if I wanted to, pick it up sometimes. I pick up neither. But get this Apple freaks -- the Kindle has a &amp;lt;i>nicer&amp;lt;/i> screen. It's heavier. And it's not an iPad so I don't really know how to use it. 	Disclaimers: YMMV. IMHO. AANW. (Apple assholes not welcome.)The new electorate	It's fascinating to watch the Republican pundits hash it out post-election. I find many of them are saying things I wished they would have said before the election. Particularly this &amp;lt;a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-real-gop-fiasco-fairness/">wonderful piece&amp;lt;/a> by Wick Allison at The American Conservative. Really nails it. Top to bottom. 	This &amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpiiXxl_kn4">Obama ad&amp;lt;/a> came out shortly after Romney's 47 percent video. Something Republicans should think about now. And &amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=B9xCCaseop4">this one&amp;lt;/a> too. 		&amp;lt;iframe width="400" height="225" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GpiiXxl_kn4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>		&amp;lt;iframe width="400" height="225" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/B9xCCaseop4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/11/19/121119fa_fact_lizza">Ryan Lizza&amp;lt;/a> in the New Yorker explains how the Republican Party is one state away from no longer being a national party. If they lose Texas, the Democrats will have a lock on the White House. No more "battleground" states. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/12/johnVLindsay.gif" width="145" height="216" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named johnVLindsay.gif">&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/obama-class-war-2012-11/">Jonathan Chait&amp;lt;/a> writes in New York that we just had a class war, and the middle class won. But now that the war is over, "what the people want is all fairly beside the point," he says. It's understandable, given what he does, that he feels that way, but he couldn't be more wrong. 	When everything settles down to the new normal, the pundits' view will probably be only slightly different from the old one. But the people, I think, are ready to move faster than the pundits are. I think part of the Democratic Party gets that, but I don't think they'll give up the power they would need to, in order for them to change at the pace the electorate is ready for. 	I knew we'd get here. Obama won by making his own excellent Facebook. But we need our own tools, so we can drive the political process even when there isn't a looming national election.	The people have to drive their own policy. 	And it's happening -- legalization of marijuana was not a corporate-driven thing. Wasn't done by lobbyists. Same with gay marriage. 	So the pundits will stay in the new reality where they are comfortable. And for the first time in a generation, the people get to drive on into the future, and define where we're going next. Tech reporting is often nonsense	&amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/horseracePunditryIsOver">The horserace school&amp;lt;/a> of election coverage has been debunked. 	But it's not the only kind of reporting that's based on the gut feel of people who don't know what they're talking about.	Tech reporting is a great case in point. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/11/mrNatural.gif" width="150" height="149" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named mrNatural.gif">Look at this &amp;lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ios-software-2012-11?op=1">article&amp;lt;/a> at Business Insider that says because they shuffled the chairs at the top level of management at Apple they can predict that a similar kind of revolution is coming soon in their software. The reporter thinks that Apple's mobile OS is no longer innovative, so the whole thing will be redesigned, deployed, somehow, in as little time as it takes to move one exec out and the other in. Never mind that the new exec isn't even a software developer. 	"It's Time For Apple To Unleash A Major Software Overhaul," they say. Sigh.	You don't have to be an engineer to be a reporter, but you do have to pay attention. Unless you want to sound like an idiot.	When was the last time an OS got a total overhaul because an exec thought it needed one? Well, that was a trick question cause it happens all the time, of course. And how often are they disasters? Unfortunately for the companies, the execs and most importantly, the users -- that happens all the time too. So much so, that a smart company never undertakes such an overhaul without lots of process. Years of planning, and then it probably doesn't work. Look at how many times Microsoft tried it. Apple too, but in the last decade, they've been much more conservative. And that's a &amp;lt;i>good&amp;lt;/i> thing. 	Now here's some more bluntness -- &amp;lt;i>iOS is itself the major retooling. &amp;lt;/i>	Reading the tea leaves you can see that they had the idea that gradually they would bring iOS features to the Mac OS. If you quickly traveled to 2015 or 2018 and booted up what they're selling as a desktop then, you'd be booting up iOS, with the old Mac OS in a compatibility box to run your legacy apps. I think this didn't work out as they hoped it would, that the cultures are so dramatically different, that they couldn't make the transition work. As a Mac user who also uses iOS -- I certainly hope so.	Apple would be ill-advised at this point to rip up the UI of iOS and start over. Too many users. Too many braincells already aligned to the way it works. That's why progress happens so slowly in OSes. And in so many other everyday things that billions of people use.	You could complain that iOS and Android are very much alike in UIs. And so are the UIs of Buicks and Toyotas. It has to be that way. It's &amp;lt;i>good&amp;lt;/i> that it is that way. It means that our skills are transferable. It keeps lock-in to a minimum. 	I guess reporters have to have something to write about, and maybe there isn't enough. But don't expect a major overhaul of Apple's mobile OS. It would be better for everyone if they concentrated in the next few years on fixing bugs and smoothing things out. Horserace punditry is over	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/10/horse.gif" width="145" height="114" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named horse.gif">Political reporting, as we've just seen in the cycle completed this week, is 99 percent horserace. But if you read and believed Nate Silver, as the race progressed, polling became more accurate, and it was fascinating to watch the pundits diverge from what the numbers were showing. Silver's model has been tested in two presidential runs, and both times it predicted the outcome in every state, &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/res_comicus/status/267389980605829120">almost&amp;lt;/a> perfectly. The 99 percent of political reporting that's about the horserace is over, obviated and unnecessary, now that we've got automated and near-perfect horserace data, thanks to Silver.	Other elements of previously standard politics that were debunked:	1. Negative advertising. Users pretty much figured it out when the ads were lies, and discounted them. Some of the lies even backfired, the candidates basically spending money to slime themselves.	2. Voter suppression didn't work either. The voters tuned in, and just waited in lines that were supposed to make them go home. I don't think the Republicans will try such an open and obvious trick again.	3. The idea that anything any candidate says is off the record. Kind of amazing that after the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r90z0PMnKwI">macaca&amp;lt;/a> disaster, that Romney allowed himself to bear such terrible witness against himself. Pretty much have to expect that won't happen again. Not that the candidate will guard better so his off the record statements are not caught on tape, rather it'll be seen as too dangerous to nominate someone who is so thoroughly narcissistic, arrogant and dishonest. 	The Obama campaign won basically by creating their own private Facebook, with unique features for political campaigns. You could argue that Obama's network is even more valuable than Zuck's. Maybe this is his Presidential library, or his version of the Carter Center or the Clinton Global Initiative. Only this time you might call it ObamaBook. The ultimate political machine. 	But I don't think ObamaBook is the last word. In this campaign the electorate was networked in ways that were not controlled by the media or the parties. That's only going to grow over the years. I hope that we'll eventually take over the political process, and the voters will start driving the discourse, not just during election season, but all the time. How to spot an outliner	I went to a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8170845088/in/photostream/lightbox/">basketball game&amp;lt;/a> last night with Doc Searls, and after the game we went out for a bite to eat. And we had a long talk, as we always do. 	Conversations with Doc are like multi-dimensional tennis. He always hits the ball back over the net. But sometimes he hits two or three. And then I hit two or three. All of a sudden there are all these threads going on, and of course since conversation is mostly linear a lot of them drop on the floor. My mind picks them up later. 	One of the things I wanted to say to Doc, who is a long-term outliner guy, is that there's an easy way to spot an outliner. They start sentences like this. There are three reasons for doing this. First, blah blah and second, blah blah and third etc etc. (I heard him doing this several times last night and made note in my mind to come back to this later.)	We tend to put bullet points on our conversations.	I, of course, am an outliner dude myself.	I'm happiest in rattling off lists of things that, together, make up a chain of thought.	My mind just organizes things that way for me.	It's as if it has a secretary that neatens everything up before delivering it to my mouth or fingers (for typing on the keyboard).	If you don't believe me, read the &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/steveWouldntHaveShippedTheIpadMini">previous piece&amp;lt;/a>. :-)This is not Steve's Apple	First, I have been an Apple shareholder for about 10 years. I haven't sold my stock, yet -- but for the first time I'm thinking about it. I'm worried that I'll decide to sell after it's too late. 	Anyway -- here's the thing. I bought an iPad Mini. It was too cheap not to give in to curiosity, to see if it's more compelling or useful or whatever, than the high-end iPad that I already have. Executive summary: It is not.	Here's the list of problems.	1. I already had a great iPad. It's big and heavy, and hurts my arm to read in bed. It's my primary bed computer, and also the second screen when I'm watching TV. When I read in bed it leaves impressions on my arm where it rests. I can't imagine this is good for the circulation in my arm. 	2. I could use the iPad Mini, but I don't. People say they don't mind the grainier screen, but I do. If I have a choice, and I do, I always pick up the bigger iPad with the easy-to-read high resolution screen.	3. What about as a traveling computer? Well, there too I go for the larger iPad, because it has LTE. It's very functional, in my knapsack, when I go out. I swtich it over from wifi to LTE when I go out. And I turn on Bluetooth, so that my iPod (blue, 32GB) has a way to get on the net. The iPad Mini could be a replacement for the iPod, I suppose. But it doesn't fit in the pocket as well. (However it does fit in my pocket, which is cool. Maybe I should try replacing the iPod with the Mini.)	4. But here's the verdict, the reason why I think this product is making Apple's stock dive. Steve never would have shipped it. I know people have been saying that about all kinds of things ever since he died. Steve wouldn't have done this or that. I've stayed away from saying that -- even though the thought has popped into my head -- because I've never felt certain, and I don't think it's fair to say something like that unless you really feel it in your gut. But this one is kind of obvious. Technology has to keep getting better. Once you've shipped an iPad with a super high-resolution "retina" display, you can't ask people to buy a new one that doesn't have it. Steve wouldn't have done it. 	5. Some features are just features, like a camera, but the resolution of a display isn't a feature. It's integral to the product. It's like trying to sell a car with a fuzzy windshield. Everything you do with the Mini is a reminder that you could be using a nicer product. Always having the nicest thing is what Steve's Apple stood for. 	6. The new Apple is willing to compromise. And what are they compromising for? Well, it looks like they're doing it so they can "compete" with Google and Amazon. But again -- Steve's Apple never deigned to do something as crass as "competing." It was a foreign concept. Steve's Apple was so far in advance of everyone else, it was ridiculous to think of them as competition. But here is the new Apple inviting comparison to something else. But the comparison that's inevitable and damning, is the comparison between the Mini and its predecessor, the iPad 3. And in that comparison the newer product is a dust-catcher. Its battery is always fully charged. It never gets off the night table. It was an obsolete product the day it shipped, and the day &amp;lt;i>before&amp;lt;/i> it shipped. 	BTW, this is why the orchestrated reviews of products are often worthless. I invite Mossberg, Pogue or Gruber to re-review their iPad Mini now, a week after their initial reviews, and let us know if they're actually using it. And if they still think it's a winner. I believe it's not only not a winner, but it signals a new Apple that's no longer beyond compare, no longer insisting on delighting its users to the point of orgasm. This Apple is content to be a competitor. Not my idea of what Apple is, and definitely not Steve's. My new blogging platform	A few months ago, I'll have to look up the date, I switched to a new worldoutline-based blogging platform.	I wanted something that would be halfway between a formal blogging tool, and Twitter.	Here's why. Because I found myself with things to say that couldn't fit into 140 characters. I think by now this happens to everyone. 	So I wanted an environment that would feel as fluid and as casual as Twitter, but have no limits on length. I wanted to be able to edit as much as I want, and then quickly move on to the next piece.	"Fluid" writing is the big thing. I didn't want to have to think about creating a blog post. I'd just start writing. If I didn't like the way it was coming out, I could just delete it and it would leave no trace behind. I'd never had a platform where the collection of all my posts was nothing more than a document. I've always wanted that, but until recently I hadn't gotten there. 	I just wrote two blog posts in about ten minutes. 	That's what I'm talking about.	Blog posts that feel like a sequence of tweets.	I've got that working -- and it feels &amp;lt;i>great. &amp;lt;/i>	One of the downsides is far more typos and spelling errors.	But -- far more of my ideas make it out of my brain and onto the net.	Whether it means anything to anyone but me remains to be seen. :-)The people are never a lame duck	Most of the punditry in Washington isn't worth a bucket of warm spit.	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/09/duck.gif" width="125" height="173" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named duck.gif">Take this &amp;lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/09/obama-second-term-soaring-rhetoric-lame-duck">op-ed&amp;lt;/a> in the Guardian that say that because of gridlock in Washington it will be impossible for the President do do anything in his second term that matches what he got done in the first. They don't know that, and they like to pretend they do -- but they're just being lazy.	Less than two weeks ago New York City was being flooded by a hurricane of such strength with such a huge surge that it wasn't even considered possible before it happened. That triggered an immediate priority, what are we going to do to protect New York against future flooding? And more important, what are we going to do to protect the other coastal cities in the United States. A huge number of Americans live in danger of the kind of flooding we experienced in New York at the end of October.	And that's just one thing. 	Who knows what kind of winter we're going to have in NY?	And where the next drought will hit.	For the Repubs -- where is the next Benghazi.	You think any of those would disrupt the gridlock?	The gridlock isn't some sacred thing. If we push hard, the gridlock will break. Congresspeople are sissies. They really don't have much spine when the people are on their ass. 	Life isn't that predictable. You don't know what's going to happen. We shouldn't waste our time thinking in such hum-drum terms. We could have a revolution, a legal revolution. I think it's going to happen one of these years. 	What do we have to revolt about? Well, &amp;lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/federal-judge-on-ohios-ballot-order-democracy-dies-in-the-dark/264983/">voter suppression&amp;lt;/a> for one thing! It's outrageous. And surprise -- the people figured it out, and they were outraged. For once the books balanced. :-)	Some of these &amp;lt;a href="http://www.plunderbund.com/2012/11/08/husteds-latest-idea-would-have-handed-ohio-to-romney/">diseased&amp;lt;/a> &amp;lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/09/florida-voting-republicans_n_2101802.html">people&amp;lt;/a> should go to jail. 	When you call the President a lame duck you're necessarily saying the People are also a lame duck. And if you read the Constitution, and believe we could be motivated to push back a little more, the People are &amp;lt;i>never&amp;lt;/i> a lame duck.Thanks President Clinton	I haven't heard anyone talking about the contribution President Bill Clinton made to the re-election of President Obama. So I decided to do something about it...	&amp;lt;a href="http://thankspresidentclinton.com/">http://thankspresidentclinton.com/&amp;lt;/a>	If you concur, please pass that URL along so everyone can take a moment and pay homage to The Big Dog, who played a big role in this year's victories.Why Romney Lost	The meme du jour is &amp;lt;i>Why Romney Lost.&amp;lt;/i> 	It's really not so hard to figure out.		&amp;lt;i>"There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what.These are people who pay no income tax."&amp;lt;/i>	You don't have to look any further. Basically this limited the field of possible Republican voters to people who were too stupid to get that he was &amp;lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser">talking&amp;lt;/a> about them. 		&amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/03/29/theRepublicanPhilosophy.html">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/09/fuckYou.gif" width="145" height="167" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named fuckYou.gif">&amp;lt;/a>Aside from being insulting, it's clueless. 		I have a pre-existing condition, and if for some reason I lost my health insurance, I would not be able to replace it, no matter how much money I spent. I have never not had insurance. The system is terrible. I had to scramble to find insurance when I lost my job a few years back. Ironically, it was the health care law in Massachusetts that saved my ass. 		I'm willing to pay for the average cost for a person with my health, I think that's fair. But health care is already highly socialized. I get the same treatment as everyone else with the condition I have. We need to pool our resources.		I don't feel &amp;lt;i>entitled&amp;lt;/i> to health care. I am a very productive member of society, and I find it highly insulting that the Republicans think I depend on them to give me a sense of purpose with my life. That's just laughable it's so arrogant and ridiculous. 		So if you want an idea of why this approach didn't work, join the human race -- and you'll find out right away. 	As another famous Republican said: "You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time." 	In this case you could only fool 53 percent. And some of them were Democrats.	As President Clinton says -- it's just arithmetic.	PS: I wish President Obama had thanked President Clinton in his victory speech. It would have brought the house down. &amp;lt;a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/09/08/2990487/why-they-call-bill-clinton-big.html">The Big Dog&amp;lt;/a> really earned it."They don't know they're dead"	I find it fascinating that Mitt Romney and his advisors went into election night &amp;lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57547239/adviser-romney-shellshocked-by-loss/">thinking&amp;lt;/a> they were going to win. Reminds me of the famous "I see dead people" scene from &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Sense">The Sixth Sense&amp;lt;/a> with Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis.	&amp;lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GldaunhaG-U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>Boehner on ObamaCare	Speaker Boehner &amp;lt;a href="http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/08/15029606-boehner-obamacare-is-the-law-of-the-land?lite=">says&amp;lt;/a> that ObamaCare is the law of the land.	1. So there you have it -- a clear mandate from the election. Whether you knew it or not, when you voted for Obama, you were making health reform in the US a reality. But there were other mandates.	2. You were also protecting Roe v Wade, and making a more liberal Supreme Court much more likely.	3. Another sure thing is a tax increase for the wealthy. Taxes may go up for everyone else. 		The President has a lot more chips in the upcoming negotiation than the Republicans do, because they can only pass legislation or stop new legislation. The tax increase is already law. All the President has to do is this -- nothing. 		Read &amp;lt;a href="http://nymag.com/news/politics/elections-2012/obama-romney-economic-plans-2012-10/">Chait's piece&amp;lt;/a> for the full story.		Also &amp;lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-07/obamas-holding-the-cards">Businessweek&amp;lt;/a>: "Obama and the Democrats can gain a huge source of new revenue by doing nothing at all."The world is socialist, part II	I try to save big ideas for January 1, every year. 	Hard things to write, things that take a while to think about, both as ideas, and how I want to approach it in writing. 	On January 1, 2011, I wrote a piece called &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/01/theWorldIsSocialist.html">The world is socialist&amp;lt;/a>. 	It was intended as a rebuttal to the idea that was going around that our President is a socialist, somehow more radical than all his predecessors, and that was somehow a threat to people who live in the United States. 	It was said a lot during the campaign (I'm looking at you Peterffy) and now in the aftermath, they're still trotting it out. We're going off the cliff because the President is socialist. It's so sad to see people so adrift, for a couple of big reasons.	1. The President is no more socialist than any other President.	2. &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/01/theWorldIsSocialist.html">The world is socialist&amp;lt;/a> (as I said in the piece I wrote).	Even the wild west, the supposed ideal of individuality, was highly socialist. The government gave people free land. The government moved the Native Americans out of the way when the Europeans wanted to harvest the buffalo or steal their land. Or is "liberty" something that only applies to white folk?	Snowstorms are socialist as are hurricanes. When the city gets dumped on we have the roads cleared by the Department of Sanitation, government workers. You don't get a specific bill for this, it's covered under your taxes.	And taxes. Rich folk pay more, because they get more. The companies they own use more roads, water, education, police. We have to pay for these services. If you don't want to contribute, then you shouldn't take the services. That is, you should move somewhere else. Because just by living you're using the protective services of the government, the police, the military, etc. 	And health care. Should your life be ruined because you get a curable disease? We've decided no. Is that socialist? Perhaps. But then disease, like snow and hurricanes, is socialist too.	Well, read the &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/01/theWorldIsSocialist.html">piece&amp;lt;/a>. In the follow-up to the election this would be a nice one to get out of the way. We, who voted Democratic this year, are no more or less socialist than you are. If you think otherwise, then tell me how. Do you not drive on roads? Do need to breathe clean air? Do you go to public events that are kept peaceful by the police? Do you like to have clean water running into your house? Do you want your neigbors to flush their toilets into the street? Etc.Strange numbers	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/08/cards.gif" width="165" height="127" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named cards.gif">I don't have a handle on this yet, because it's become virtually impossible to tell how traffic from Twitter arrives. But the hit counts on my short URLs are going way down. I used to get two or three thousand clicks on each one, as recently as a couple of months ago. Now I get two or three &amp;lt;i>hundred&amp;lt;/i> clicks. I don't know what to attribute this to. 	I recently started supporting the &amp;lt;a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards">Twitter Cards&amp;lt;/a> feature, so you get a 200-character synopsis of each piece on Twitter, without clicking through. 	I'm not sure this is such a good deal. :-)	I'm very concerned that we're turning over all our flow to a small number of companies. And we can't tell whether they're passing our tweets along to everyone who follows us. I'm beginning to wonder about that too.What Republicans look like, to me	&amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/itsAGoodDay">Yesterday&amp;lt;/a>: "Romney did something with integrity by saying we need to get behind the President. If Romney had won, Obama's supporters, most of them, would have swallowed hard and gotten behind the new President and hoped for the best."	I got a response from someone who I later blocked, who said that before we got behind the new President, we would riot and loot first. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Bunker">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/08/archieBunker.gif" width="95" height="126" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named archieBunker.gif">&amp;lt;/a>Then I read this &amp;lt;a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/obama-speech-election-night-2012-14528957">piece&amp;lt;/a> by Tom Junod on Esquire where he said: "Though they will be back soon enough with their philosophy of limited government, they will heretofore practice their tried-and-true strategy of demonizing segments of the American population at their peril."	I thought these two go together. I wanted to tell my correspondent that I am a middle-aged white, affluent, educated person, who would never in a million years riot or loot anyone or anything. I realize of course that there's no point in saying that, if his intentions were respectful, he would already know that. 	This is how a lot of us see Republicans. I thought people who think of themselves as Republicans who aren't like this should know that. As Repubs try to figure it out	A few notes for Republicans trying to figure this election out, and for everyone actually -- because there was some new stuff.	1. The late-breaking ad run by Romney that said Jeep was moving jobs to China blew back in his face. The people figured it out. And they had great communication tools to share the news with each other. The message: "Romney is a dick."	2. When Akin said the awful stuff about women and rape, that presented an A-B choice to the Republican leadership. They seemed to understand that, because they called on Akin to step aside. When he didn't, they stuck with him. I assume Republican strategists figured that while maybe it would be an issue in Missouri, the rest of us would forget about it. We didn't. And then it happened again in Indiana. This time the Republican leadership didn't say anything. What if, instead, Romney had made a big deal about it, like the Obama race speech in 2008. Cut support for Akin, on principle. That would have changed the tone of the campaign. But this isn't the kind of thing a Romney does. And that's a big part of why he isn't President-elect Romney. He isn't willing to take a risk for a big reward. He's a numbers guy. Not a good guy to be Leader of the Free World. (Not that we haven't already had presidents like that, we have.)		He said in his concession speech that he and Ryan had "left everyting on the field." Not true. He didn't take any personal risks other than telling ever-more-bold lies about himself. If he had taken a principled stand on &amp;lt;i>something&amp;lt;/i> maybe a few more voters would have looked into his eyes and seen some of the conscience his friends says he has. But if he has it, it never showed up in the campaign. Quite the opposite -- his calculating "I'll say whatever I have to say to get your vote" attitude is what we saw 100 percent of the time. 			&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/aQruYgVP2SY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>		Akin and Mourdock teed up a perfect opportunity for him to stand for something. How much guts would it have taken to completely withdraw support from these guys? Sure it would have made enemies in the Republican Party. But it would have given him at least one anchor to the human race, for the rest of us to connect with. "At least he's willing to stand up for a woman who was raped." (It sounds terrible to say it that way, but that &amp;lt;i>is&amp;lt;/i> what it comes down to.)	3. Romney sealed it with his &amp;lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser">47 percent comment&amp;lt;/a> at the Florida fundraiser. These were familiar ideas. It sounded authentic, like this is what Romney really thinks. No matter how competent you think a guy is, he has abstracted a huge number of American voters to be sub-human. If that's what it takes to hold his world together, I don't want to live in that world. I was already decided not to vote for him, and I didn't imagine there would have been anything he could say to change my mind, but when the debates came around...	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/07/think.gif" width="145" height="117" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named think.gif">4. The mistake Obama appeared to make was to paint Romney as a cretin, incompetent, dumb, rich, inbred jerk. Well, you could see, in the debate, he wasn't that. He could think on his feet. Put a good sentence together. And he had the fire that Obama lacks. If I had been on the fence (again, I wasn't) that debate might have pushed me over. If he hadn't shared the 47 percent bit, that might have made a difference. There was a moment in the first debate when a thought popped into my head that he's the real president. It wasn't something I reasoned my way to, it was a flash of insight. I imagine this is the feeling, that other people had too, that made his poll numbers go up. 	5. I think he disqualified himself with the bullshit about Benghazi. People were dying, we didn't know how many. The situation was fluid, and there was Mitt sticking his two cents in. Really some people don't have good intuition for politics. Romney proved that day he was one of them. 	6. Don't make jokes about climate change or birth certificates.	7. I think the biggest lesson of 2012 is that the people are much better connected now than they ever have been. That means that bold manipulative lies don't work, because they can be exposed, quickly, by networks of &amp;lt;i>people&amp;lt;/i> that voters trust. In the past, politics was totally centralized. Like everything else, it is not centralized anymore. We have fact-checkers, we can listen to them, and now apparently enough people do that we can enforce a certain discipline on our candidates. 	8. Given the circumstances of the economy, Romney could have won. That's why Republicans should hear this loud and clear. If you run as the Party of Cretins you're going to keep losing. It might take a few years for the transition to be complete. If the Republicans want to reform, they should reform along the lines of empowered voters with good access to information. And show respect for everyone. Don't nominate patricians like Romney. Nominate people with decent political instincts, who would never say the kinds of trashy things Romney said, no matter how much depends on it.Election almanac e-book?	It would be useful to have an e-book you could buy for say $10 put out by a reputable news organization, that gathers, in book form, all the information about the election we have, almanac-style.	It would be updated as new information comes in. Eventually it would stop updating.Dear Repubs, we heard you	Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell on the top Republican priority, two years ago. It wasn't jobs. Not deficit or ending wars. Not health care.	&amp;lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/W-A09a_gHJc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	The United States paid dearly for this. 	If you think we forgot, we didn't. It's a good day	Lots of good stuff today.	1. Obama won re-election.	2. He gave a great speech.	3. Romney gave a great concession speech.	4. As of today, Romney becomes a punchline to bad jokes. Had he won, he still would have been the punchline to bad jokes, but they would have also been tragic jokes. 	5. Obama talked about climate change in his speech.	6. He talked about self-government, implying possibly that he will help organize the people to do things that help our country regain some semblance of grounding. It's very true. In this country the people have all the power. But if you never work with us, if you treat us like mere voters, we can't work together. The President, of all the branches of government, must work with the people. Must &amp;lt;i>like&amp;lt;/i> the people. And must lead the people. When the Repubs said the President wasn't leading, they were right. They could push us around because there was no connection betw the President and the people.	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/07/think.gif" width="145" height="117" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named think.gif">7. By keeping things as they are, with the Senate and House, we told the government that they have to put the bullshit aside and start working for the good of the country. Some people will say this was a message to both parties, but that would be a mistaken interpretation. The message was to the Republicans. I don't know about you, but I heard them say they were being jackasses and holding the economy hostage to try to make Obama a one-term president. I assumed from that point on all the talk about principles was just smoke, covering for their remarkably honest admission. We all paid a huge price for the vanity of the Republican Party. No more of that or we will punish you with obliteration. And maybe we have a President now who knows how to organize the people.	8. To Republicans, you may not like Obama, and I'm sorry you feel that way, but you have to man-up and deal with it. He not only is the President but he was just re-elected. Stop insulting the majority by saying we elected someone who is not legit. Don't be sore losers. Nothing is more un-American and honestly its disgusting to see grown men and women act like that. Romney did something with integrity by saying we need to get behind the President. If Romney had won, Obama's supporters, most of them, would have swallowed hard and gotten behind the new President and hoped for the best. 	9. I think our new President got the message about the Republicans. They will be bastards if they feel they can get away with it. So take &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Stick_ideology">Teddy Roosevelt's advice&amp;lt;/a>. Speak softly and carry a big stick.	10. The fiscal cliff is no problem. Read Jonathan Chait's &amp;lt;a href="http://nymag.com/news/politics/elections-2012/obama-romney-economic-plans-2012-10/">excellent piece&amp;lt;/a> on this subject. Opened my eyes.	11. If the Repubs want to play a game of chicken on the debt ceiling, again, I have two words for you: &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/us/politics/25legal.html">14th Amendment&amp;lt;/a>. Dare them to impeach you. Look into the camera and tell the American people that we don't negotiate with terrorists. And mean it. This is where your new &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/october/mrPresidentGrowAPair">cojones&amp;lt;/a> come into it. Last time around when you took the 14th Amendment off the table, that's when you sealed our defeat. See #9.	12. ObamaCare FTW! When people see how much it helps they will love it. The law goes into effect in major ways next year, and with an executive branch that owns it, it has a much better chance. The Repubs will still try to starve its funding, but that's much better than having them try to dismantle it, as they would have under a President Romney.	13. Even better, the Supreme Court will not be packed with Alito-Thomas-Scalia clones. More Kagans and Sotomayors, please. And Ginsburgs and Breyers and sheez even another John Roberts wouldn't be so bad. 	14. Maybe Netanyahu will stop trying to go behind President Obama's back.	In general, the President Obama we're getting in 2013 is much improved over the one we got in 2009. This one has battle scars. The old one was remarkably naive about the Republicans. We all knew what he didn't seem to know -- they're bastards. They don't like you and they don't want to work with you. But they have to if you use the bully pulpit. You have all the power that Franklin Roosevelt had, if you choose to use it. He had radio. You have even better tools. Use them or become the red meat that the Republican jackals eat for lunch.Today we're the Decider-in-Chief	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500159_162-1523934.html">Bush said&amp;lt;/a> he was the Decider-in-Chief.	A couple of days ago Bill Clinton picked up the idea and &amp;lt;a href="http://charlotte.cbslocal.com/2012/11/05/clinton-steals-bushs-decider-in-chief-phrase-to-describe-obama/">gave it&amp;lt;/a> to the President.	But today is a special day. The day when &amp;lt;i>we're&amp;lt;/i> The Decider.	We still haven't done enough with it. But one day maybe we will do more.	If we declare our independence from the two parties, and run the next election ourselves, and it's possible -- we have the means to do it -- we can fight a revolution and win. And keep the attention of our leaders long before and after Election Day. And not just on superficial "values" issues, but issues of war and peace, how the economy works, and whether we're serious about saving the planet. 	But no matter what, don't pay attention to people who say your vote doesn't matter. They're wrong. It does. The act of voting is like exercise. When you run a mile, you end up at the same spot you started at, and you give up an hour of your life. But you have done something. You've preserved your power to do something tomorrow and the day after. Same with voting. Even if you vote for someone you hate, you've still voted. The act itself still matters. And someday it will have more meaning, I'm sure of it.My favorite moviesIf Obama wins	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/05/jets.gif" width="145" height="83" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named jets.gif">My wish if Obama wins tomorrow is that he start building a cross-party coalition with his new buds Chris Christie and Bill Clinton. Go to a Jets game maybe. Ask Christie which Repubs are fun to party with. Bring them along too. Start a new informal Cabinet of advisers, people the President hangs with to talk sports or drink a beer or (privately) smoke some reefer. Then they plot out new ways to get the whole country working, not just the tri-state area. We have something much bigger than Sandy to recover from, that is if Obama wins. 	If &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/08/31/muchToHateInRomney.html">Romney&amp;lt;/a> &amp;lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/politics-national/2012/11/seven-people-predicting-a-romney-win-on-election-day/">wins&amp;lt;/a>, god help us. 	Update: If Lindsey Graham keeps saying &amp;lt;a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/11/05/quote_of_the_day.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PoliticalWire+%28Political+Wire%29">shit like this&amp;lt;/a> he can come to the football game too. 	Update: Wouldn't it be fun if Obama named Bill Clinton as &amp;lt;i>Secretary of Getting People to Work Together?&amp;lt;/i> I heard Clinton give a &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2008/01/26/findASharedVision.html">speech&amp;lt;/a> at the end of his second term where he advised that we all "find a shared vision." This is every bit as much needed today as it was in 2000.Pando on corporate platforms	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/05/cowboy.gif" width="125" height="244" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named cowboy.gif">A surprising &amp;lt;a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/11/03/how-ecosystems-became-the-new-walled-gardens/">piece&amp;lt;/a> by Kevin Kelleher in Pando about lock-in on corporate platforms. It's surprising because none of the California tech blogs have been looking at the possibility that the corporate platforms might not be a permanent fixture. And Pando has been one of the most conservative, imho. It's great to see them look in this direction.	Eventually the lock-in will break. It would be smart for one of the platforms to decide that as a business strategy they'll try to create an &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/04/whatIMeanByTheOpenWeb.html">open platform&amp;lt;/a> with replaceable components. Let people use different editors, browsers, let them hook in their own back-ends. Create a real ecosystem, with &amp;lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/25292888">freedom&amp;lt;/a>, constructed the same way the web is, using formats and protocols that already exist, where ever possible. This really can work. 	They would be promising to compete on quality, performance, features and price, not lock-in. It's really the honest way to go, and lots of industries work this way. For example, I can buy a Ford, Toyota, BMW or Smart car -- and drive on the same roads and use the same fuel. Everything is interchangeable about them except the key that gets me in and starts the engine. It's a good model for how our communication systems should work, at all levels.	Products like Twitter or Instagram are providing useful features, they really don't need to lock their users in. They will possibly survive this transition, if they're flexible when it happens. There's lots of examples of past transitions to study for possible strategies. How much does the NYT cost?	Here's a story for a reporter at the NY Times.	Find out how much I, a resident of the city of New York, a blogger, would have to pay per month for a digital subscription to the Times. 		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/04/nytoffer.gif" width="637" height="923" border="0" alt="A picture named nytoffer.gif">	Is it like a phone company contract? Do I have to sign up for one year? Two years? I'd much prefer to buy a month at a time like a no-contract cell phone. But sometimes it's hard to get rid of these things, like AOL. I had to talk to them several times, many years ago, to get them to stop billing me $20 a month. Given the deceptive way the NYT markets digital subscriptions, I strongly suspect they're like that when you want to say goodbye. 	I don't care how much it costs for the first 12 weeks. That's such an insult. As a reader of the NY Times, I expect you to lay out the information clear unambiguous terms. It's such a contradiction that the Times markets itself this way.	I honestly don't know how much it costs. But if it's not too unreasonable I probably would have bought in a long time ago. To the Times, the way you're marketing this product is totally inconsistent with the values of the product you're trying to sell. I don't care if this gets more people to buy in, you're never going to get my business until you level with me, in a Times-like way. What are red state folks saying?	If Romney wins, we won't have to worry about what the red states are saying -- we'll hear it every day in the form of legislation, tax policy, executive orders. But if Obama wins, we have a chance to try to grow the majority through the simple act of listening. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/04/2004.gif" width="145" height="90" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named 2004.gif">On the surface the red state folks say things that we know are not true, and most of them probably do too. The president &amp;lt;i>is&amp;lt;/i> American. He is no more a socialist than any Republican president ever was. It's all repetitive talking points given to them by their pundits. Same as the Democrat pundits on MSNBC give their people idiotic talking points. A lot of my friends think there's a difference. If anything the MSNBC dogma is richer than the Fox News bullshit. That kind of crap isn't worth listening to or arguing with. Time-wasters. The people who really believe that are hopeless. They are drugged into a coma.	I also say we should not focus on policy issues, because they are mostly symbols, ways of expressing a more fundamental distrust, dislike, perhaps even in some cases hatred of east and west coast liberals. It's the fundamental things below that, what the symbols are expressing, that we should focus on, because they have validity.	That may sound surprising, that the source of hate is valid, but it is -- and until we listen to it, and try to understand what causes it, we will not grow the majority. What if we can give them what they want? What if they feel the world is moving too fast and leaving them behind? Is that something we can relate to? We all feel that to a certain extent. My guess is that people in flyover territory generalize about people on the coasts, just like we generalize about them. We're all greedy, powerful, ignorant and rich. 	But people voting for Obama are not all alike. And middle class people have similar issues whether they live in the Bronx or Jacksonville, Florida. 	On the networks we hear from people in Louisiana saying that finally the people up north have a taste of what it's like to be them. That's sad, because that didn't just happen. It's been like that all along. People in Staten Island and Rockaway have always been forgotten. &amp;lt;i>Just like people in Louisiana. &amp;lt;/i>	The crazy thing is we all feel forgotten. Every one of us. Even the chairman of Chase or the mayor of New York or the governor of New Jersey feel unheard and unappreciated. I think that's the symbol we're all trying to manipulate, to light a huge flare, to send a message saying very simply -- hey I'm here, don't forget me. 	That's why the visual symbols of the people jumping off the WTC holding hands, or standing on roofs in New Orleans waiting for rescue, or lining up for gas in New Jersey, while differing in degree, are all expressing the same idea. I'm lost, we're all lost, we have no idea what we're doing, and &amp;lt;i>what we're doing isn't working.&amp;lt;/i> This isn't a new idea with Obama. This has been our problem in America ever since the 60s, the last time we, as a country had a mission.	The way things are, our leaders will never come up with the answer. We have to do that ourselves. It's a game of inches. It's two people communicating and helping each other across the red-blue divide. It's bi-partisanship not in Washington, it's bi-partisanship between us.		&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/myyWXKeBsNk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>Crowd-sourcing the election	A note for next time, let's not let &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Adelson">Shelly Adelson&amp;lt;/a> have all the fun. :-)	One thing we've &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstarter">learned&amp;lt;/a> in the last few years is that if you have an idea that tickles the imagination of enough people, you can raise a lot of money online to develop the idea. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/04/uncleSam.gif" width="145" height="193" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named uncleSam.gif">So, when a video like &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/november/theMostBrutalPoliticalAdEver">this one&amp;lt;/a> comes along, that mixes a Republican crowd mocking climate change with scenes of the Sandy disaster, we could put $50 million behind running it where ever we like.	The cool thing about this is that we could decide to run ads that our candidate would never run. We could run them in non-battleground states. Or we could run ads to make sure an issue gets discussed in debates that our favorite candidate is trying to side-step. We can make winning about making politics do for us what we want it to do, instead of settling for the compromises that come from letting individual fatcats do all the pushing. You and I may not have a billion dollars, but if we pool our resources, we can act like we do. 	Or we could run ads that shame the big spenders, reveal things about them they don't want revealed, give them an incentive to crawl back into their holes and stop pushing the rest of us around.

The fires were mostly out by then.	Having the marathon on Sunday is more like having it a few days after the hellacious &amp;lt;a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-12-27/local/27085609_1_snow-removal-transit-subway-lines">snowstorm of 2010&amp;lt;/a>. You might have been able to clear the streets for the race, but what about the streets you weren't plowing. How much money would be lost by those people not being able to get to work? I think you're looking at a much higher cost than the revenue a sporting event brings into the city. Penny-wise, pound-foolish. It's probably more money to get the bodegas and delis open all over the city. And the barber shops and halal food vendors. And get some more trees off people's houses. Re-open Central Park for the people. So totally like the mayor to focus on opening it for the media and elite runners. The &amp;lt;i>city&amp;lt;/i> needs the park. And what about people with no electricity. Give me a break. 	Another comparison. The Yankees returned home on &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=yankees+9%2F25%2F01">9/25/01&amp;lt;/a> -- two weeks after 9/11. The baseball game involved a small part of the Bronx which was far from the disaster, and all transport systems to and from the Bronx were working at the time. Most of the infrastructure of the city was unaffected by 9/11. Not true in 2012.		&amp;lt;iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=world+trade+center,+new+york,+ny&amp;amp;daddr=yankee+stadium,+bronx,+ny&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=FfM1bQIdVaSW-yHKYSw_KBEPTSlTGzgAGVrCiTHKYSw_KBEPTQ%3BFZgBbwIdnPiX-yEIHppV2cNASSlxaedaLPTCiTEIHppV2cNASQ&amp;amp;aq=&amp;amp;sll=40.697488,-73.979681&amp;amp;sspn=1.026601,0.986023&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;mra=ls&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=40.774302,-73.969574&amp;amp;spn=0.181996,0.291824&amp;amp;z=11&amp;amp;output=embed">&amp;lt;/iframe>&amp;lt;br />&amp;lt;small>&amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=embed&amp;amp;saddr=world+trade+center,+new+york,+ny&amp;amp;daddr=yankee+stadium,+bronx,+ny&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=FfM1bQIdVaSW-yHKYSw_KBEPTSlTGzgAGVrCiTHKYSw_KBEPTQ%3BFZgBbwIdnPiX-yEIHppV2cNASSlxaedaLPTCiTEIHppV2cNASQ&amp;amp;aq=&amp;amp;sll=40.697488,-73.979681&amp;amp;sspn=1.026601,0.986023&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;mra=ls&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=40.774302,-73.969574&amp;amp;spn=0.181996,0.291824&amp;amp;z=11" style="color:#0000FF;text-align:left">View Larger Map&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;/small>	More prior art.

As anger percolates over the the decision to hold the New York City Marathon, at least two hotel owners on Staten Island, where the race starts, said they would not kick out those displaced by Hurricane Sandy to accommodate runners who have reserved a room.	The rest of the piece is on the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/28/nyregion/hurricane-sandy.html?smid=tw-nytmetro#sha=0f2bab207">Times site&amp;lt;/a>, without a working permalink. But I'm sure you get the idea.	The Mayor is a smart man, but he's made a very stupid decision, to have the marathon on Sunday. I can see the preparations happening right now in Central Park. It's a massive event that uses a lot of city resources at a time when all those resources should be used to restore power and transit and probably to some degree to save lives of New Yorkers. It's certainly possible that there's damage we don't even know about.	Maybe next year we can have a marathon. But this doesn't look like an ordinary disaster, like a snowstorm, which the mayor kind of blew a couple of winters ago. 	It's important to do this rebuild right, and to include all the people of New York. Someone must get that. This is the premier &amp;lt;i>American&amp;lt;/i> city not a monarchy. As long as there are New Yorkers suffering this way, we can't have a party. 	One person said this is like Mardi Gras after Katrina. Emphatically it is not. I went to New Orleans five weeks after Katrina. There's no way that city could have had any kind of party at that point. And we're a much larger city and this wound is fresh, the bleeding and dying hasn't stopped. New Orleans had its party, seven months after the hurricane. Maybe we'll be ready for a party at that point.	People don't realize how much damage was done to our communities, and even more important to the infrastructure that connect us. It looks like these systems are really damaged. Months before they come online. it's time to sober up and get a clue, all of us. Especially our mayor.Nate is great!	I think the public editor at the NYT is just right when she &amp;lt;a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/under-attack-nate-silver-picks-the-wrong-defense/">admonished&amp;lt;/a> Nate Silver for offering a bet with Joe Scarborough. 	Nate made a mistake. Here's my take.	&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/02/heyNate.jpg" width="75" height="103" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named heyNate.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>1. I am educated, with a math degree. I've spent decades writing software. To do what I do requires a precise kind of thinking, but there's also an art to it. So when I read Nate's analysis, I recognize and appreciate it. I think Nate is one of a small number of young folk who make me optimistic about the future. I appreciate that he uses statistical methods, and I understand what you can and cannot do with stats. It's possible that Romney will win when there's an 80 percent chance of Obama winning. But, according to Nate's model, four times out of five, Obama wins. He's not 100 percent sure of it. But he's sure enough to put his honor on the line. As a believer in Nate, and a supporter of Obama, I am relieved. But -- if Nate said it was the other way around, 80 percent likely that Romney would win, I wouldn't even think of trying to discredit Nate. Instead, I'd be depressed about the future of the world. A fundamentally different way of processing negative information. :-)	2. Uneducated people probably don't understand the limits of statistical analysis. Probabilities don't come into it for them. I can't imagine that what Nate writes about makes much sense to them. 		BTW, self-educated people are just as educated as formally educated people. Not drawing a distinction between people with and without degrees.	3. Making bets with such people accomplishes nothing.	4. I have had to deal with gangs of Internet trolls for years. It happens to everyone who takes a leadership role. The more you accomplish, the more inundated with garbage you get. When I realize all the things I didn't do because I didn't have the stomach for dealing with these people it makes me really angry. If I had it to do over again I would not let them stop me. I've developed new procedures that keep them out of my way. They seem to work. Knock wood.	5. Nate may think it's possible to teach Scarborough something. If he wanted to learn, he would buy Nate's book, or take a course in stats, or listen instead of rejecting strange ideas. But that's not who he is. No matter what you say to him, his mind is not going to change. You can't open the door for him. You can't show him how wonderful your world is. He's not looking for new delights. Sad, isn't it, but there are &amp;lt;i>lots&amp;lt;/i> of people like that. They will never become Nate Silver fans. That's life!	6. You have to be satisfied by informing people who understand the process you use, or whose minds are open to new ideas.	7. The trolls will insult you for this. They will say &amp;lt;i>you&amp;lt;/i> are not open to new ideas. Maybe they believe it. I don't know why they do it. But you'll never figure it out, no matter how hard you try, because they are truly different from you. So different that you can't communicate. So give up trying. 	8. I think the Times has had this problem for generations. Long before there was an Internet. 	9. Their isolation, their aloofness, could be functional, might be a response to this reality. I've often wondered why NYT people can be such assholes. Now I have an idea. They only let certain people into their discussion space. There are only certain people they listen to. Nate is to be commended for having a broader circle that influences him. But that doesn't make the Times wrong. They are probably just reacting to the reality that there have always been low-roaders like Scarborough. People who try to stop things they don't like or understand. Tune them out. But I think they go too far, and tune out things they should be listening to, that's not meant to harm them, or stop them. But too much time may have passed for the Times, organizationally, to be able to tell the difference between a troll and someone with strange wonderful ideas. 	That's why I agree with the public editor that the bet he offered to Scarborough (which he, predictably, slimed) was a bad idea. Not something to be repeated. 	On the other hand, the Times could find ways to open up a bit more and let some strange ideas in. They suffer for being too cloistered. And those of us in their community suffer too.No marathon	&amp;lt;a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/127865-bush-katrina-flyover-photo-a-huge-mistake">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/11/01/wsmall.jpg" width="75" height="107" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named wsmall.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>There are many New Yorks right now. I am lucky -- I live in one that's coming back to life quickly. I have TV, electricity, Internet, heat. Most of the stores in my neighborhood are open. The only catastrophe that happened nearby is the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8135847951/in/photostream">crane&amp;lt;/a> that fell during the storm. But that seems to be taken care of, and its only a concern because it's caused traffic gridlock in my neighborhood. Very small problem. 	Last night I took a walk down to 4th St, went cross-town, and came back via Times Square. The contrasts were very heavy. 	I wondered how we could get the energy that's flowing through Times Square -- and everything is normal there -- to flow through the parts of the city I had just visited that are dark. 	Today for the first time we're getting a picture of what's happening in Staten Island.	What will become apparent tomorrow? And do we really want to use our resources at this time for a huge optional event when citizens and taxpayers in parts of the &amp;lt;i>same city&amp;lt;/i> are fighting for their lives? It's more ridiculous because the marathon is a citywide event. 	This the &amp;lt;i>Heckuva job Brownie&amp;lt;/i> moment for the mayor. Only a billion times worse.		&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lssbAwu-OtE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	No marathon. Bad business for NY.The paywall contradiction	&amp;lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57541898-93/hurricane-sandy-blows-down-paywalls-at-ny-times-wsj/">When I heard&amp;lt;/a> that the WSJ and NYT were turning off their paywalls for the duration of Hurricane Sandy, I felt sure there was something wrong with this, though I found it hard to put in words. 	I'm going to try now and see what happens.	When I write something publicly it's because I want to put the ideas out there and get a response. I want the benefit of other minds interacting with the idea. To limit access is opposite the purpose of writing it publicly. So every person who can't read it subtracts some of the value. If that person had a pivotal insight, one that would make me change my mind -- then all the value of publishing it is gone if I never get to hear the response because of a paywall.	One might argue that it's a matter of extent. If the paywall should come down because there's important potentially life-saving information on the site today, then it should come down tomorrow too, if the news organization is any good -- because that's &amp;lt;i>always&amp;lt;/i> true. What difference does it make if they could save one life or one thousand? To the person whose life is saved, it makes none. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/02/09/ipromisedmygrandfather.html">In 1995&amp;lt;/a>, I called the attempted censorship of the Internet in the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act">CDA&amp;lt;/a> a "crime against humanity." Some people questioned the use of that term. I offered two defenses:		&amp;lt;i>I have two answers. First, it's a felony to leave the scene of an accident, and it's a felony to blow up a Federal courthouse in Oklahoma City. Scale has nothing to do with it. If this isn't a crime against humanity, who is it a crime against? Do we hold our politicians accountable for their actions, especially if they're on a global scale? Are just US citizens offended by their attempt to shut down free speech on the Internet? No. The mail has been coming in from all over the planet. And rightly so. This act has global implications.&amp;lt;/i>	Writers and publishers have different motivations and missions. A writer's job is to spread ideas far and wide and reap the benefit. That's his art. A publisher's mission is, well I don't understand that one -- because I am a writer. :-)&lt;/pre>October 2012 = &lt;pre>I'm tired too Abby	&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OjrthOPLAKM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	BTW, the cute kid award for the 2008 election went to &amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G8ZkUezOHQ&amp;list=UUl9cwOsJNIMKZV0ezjQfhvg&amp;index=5&amp;feature=plpp_video">Ross Mayfield's son&amp;lt;/a>, talking about Obamaman. :-)Backups!	I see lots of mentions of NY-based companies that didn't have adequate Plan B's. 	It's time to think about how you're creating redundancy in your communication systems. 	Also important as a service you can offer to users to differentiate your product from others.

Wouldn't it be great if it were kept up to date on road closures and could take that into account in giving directions. The worst NY player	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/31/bigbum.gif">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/31/smallbum.gif" width="145" height="185" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named smallbum.gif">&amp;lt;/a>Harvey Araton in the Times &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/sports/basketball/amare-stoudemires-deal-with-knicks-is-worst-in-new-york-sports.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">writes&amp;lt;/a> today that the worst deal in NY sports is Amare Stoudemire of the Knicks. Hard to disagree. Except maybe Carmelo Anthony. 	As a Mets fan since 1962, let me tell you -- it is not about winning. It's about love, and philosophy. The Knicks have two leading players that play from fear and have no philosophy. I think Carmelo could play on a team lead by someone with philosophy, as he showed in the Olympics this year, but even then, under pressure, he's the first to choke. I was watching the last great game in the Olympics against Spain, hoping that Anthony would rally, but instead he was benched -- and with the usual Baby Huey smile on his face, that seemed (to me at least) to spell relief. 	The core problem of the Knicks is they chose a Number Two to be their Number One. 	Neither Anthony or Stoudemire plays with heart. They are not competitors. Neither is a leader, or a winner. That's what's so fucked up about the Knicks. 	They had a great team for a few weeks last year, sparked by a coach and a point guard who played with love and great philosophy. Chandler was happy to play along. Novak, Fields, Schumpert -- all young and looking for a chance to play -- flourished. Sure, given a chance this combination might not have won, but as I said -- as a Mets fan, and I'm sure as die-hard Knicks fans can agree -- it's not really about winning. It's about having a spirit that we can get behind. Obama and Christie FTW	1. If you haven't watched the &amp;lt;a href="http://video.pbs.org/video/2288869682">Frontline&amp;lt;/a> 2-hour election special, the rest of this might not make much sense. It's really worth watching. 		&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7MXOr3KELqE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	2. I just caught up on the politics of the day. I didn't want to, but then two pieces came out at almost exactly the same time, a few hours ago, that shifted my perspective. One from &amp;lt;a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/10/why-democrats-are-right-to-politicize-sandy.html">Jonathan Chait&amp;lt;/a> at New York, and the other by &amp;lt;a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/obama-romney-hurricane-sandy-14261227?src=rss">Charles Pierce&amp;lt;/a> at Esquire. They both said in different but equally convincing ways that the response to Sandy is political and to view it any other way is wrong. 	3. The timing is amazing, obviously. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/30/newyorker.gif" width="125" height="177" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named newyorker.gif">4. It couldn't be more dramatic in the context of the election. Because the problem being given to Obama is one he's perfectly suited for. It's the one he wanted when he arrived in Washington in 2009 and thought he had been given, in the economic collapse. Unfortunately for all of us, the Republicans responded very negatively to Obama (understatement). This was made very clear in the Frontline report (see #1). I hadn't understood how the Republicans despised him. It wasn't just expedient. They actually hated him. I didn't get this because I didn't feel that way about Obama. But I certainly have felt that way about other politicians. 		They were right in some ways. Obama believed he was transformative. That was a mistake. He should have tried to make a difference in the context of what Washington was, not what he wished it to be. He was vulnerable and naive, and they took advantage of it. 	5. Enter Christie. 	6. Unlike the Republicans in Washinton in 2009, he wants to work with Obama. Really wants to, it's not fake.	7. Why? Because he likes being governor of NJ, and here's his chance to do that in an incredible way, with all the money of the US govt available to him. All the planets lined up for Gov Christie. And Obama, seeing the opportunity (totally) says oh shit I'm getting the checkbook, and I'm going to spend the money and I got a Republican to play the game with me. "How much do you want?" he asks Christie. He gets to throw a Hail Mary pass, with almost no political cost, certainly none before the election. (I'd love to see Romney complain that Obama was spending too much on New Jersey, esp with the pictures on CNN likely to come in the days ahead. This isn't Benghazi or even Katrina. Our networks have lots of cameras and reporters in the NYC area. Even Republicans on Wall Street will want the money to be spent now. Look where the flooding happened.)	8. This is what Obama is &amp;lt;i>good&amp;lt;/i> at. Getting lots of governors, Republican and Democratic, to work with him. To let him lead and organize them. Use his intellect. Lead the team. (Give them money.) He did it at Harvard. And at Columbia and in high school. This is what he &amp;lt;i>loves. &amp;lt;/i>	9. Now here's the ridiculous part. It's probably something that Romney would be great at too. It's exactly the kind of job he seeks out. It's the way he sees himself. Disaster strikes, and Romney comes in and saves the day -- through management, competence, consensus. If this crisis, exactly this crisis, happened in February and Romney was President, he'd be Christie's buddy too, with the checkbook open ready to fill in whatever number Chris asks him to. But he won't get to do it, and he knows it, and it must absolutely drive him crazy! 	10. Christie will get to rebuild New Jersey with federal money. Before this his state was broke. Now it'll be rich. Jobs galore. He gets to be hero. And I bet he doesn't like Romney, on a personal level. And I bet he &amp;lt;i>does&amp;lt;/i> like Obama.	11. Watch the Frontline report. :-)Google Maps API overview?	I've used little scraps of time during the hurricane to &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.scripting.com/october2012/102912ByDw/googleMapsApi">experiment&amp;lt;/a> with the Google Maps API. 		&amp;lt;a href="http://googlemapstest.blorkmark.com/">http://googlemapstest.blorkmark.com/&amp;lt;/a>	I hope to simplify it so that people can set up a map in the OPML Editor outliner, by entering a list of names of places and have them appear as icons on the map. They also get to specify the icons, from the set of &amp;lt;a href="http://glypharray.blorkmark.com/">Glyphicons&amp;lt;/a>. And of course they can write a document for each, in the outliner. The outlines will be displayed more or less the same way as the About outline on &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News&amp;lt;/a> home page.	The API is pretty strange to me, largely because I've never used a Javascript API before. The callback structure is totally bizarre. I'm accustomed to the enviroment managing threads for you. To me this is an odd way to program. Which makes learing a new API doubly-difficult.	I'd rather not read a whole O'Reilly book on this API. I'd like to find a narrative to explain these topics:		1. How to turn a name of a place into a lat-lng value. I see there's an entrypoint for this, geocoder.getLatLng.		2. How to get a callback when the user clicks on an icon. It would also be nice to know where the mouse-click happened, on the screen, so the window can pop up close to it (I have no idea how to do this, but will have to figure it out).	I see this as another way to do a presentation, or to organize information. I would like to have a single outline for a map, making it super-easy to edit, and also to have it in the most convenient form for someone browsing over the data.	Any pointers are much appreciated.	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule level="1" to="1">			&amp;lt;permalink>true&amp;lt;/permalink>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	Update #1		Thanks to some pointers from Ted (see below), my &amp;lt;a href="http://googlemapstest.blorkmark.com/">test map&amp;lt;/a> now have markers that:		1. Are specified not by latitude and longitude, rather by human-understandable strings like Roosevelt Island, New York, NY and 23rd St and Park Ave, New York, NY. 		2. When roll over the icon you see the human-understandable string.		3. When you click on the icon and alert dialog pops up with the string.		This is important because the string is what's going to be in the main headline for each chunk of outline text. In a sense it's the address both in physical space and in the outline. Being able to go from a mouse-click to that string is an essential step. Hurricane status report	I'm getting tweets and emails from friends outside NY asking if everything is okay. 	1. Thanks! The concern is much appreciated. 	2. Everything is good. Power is on. No one hurt. Exhausted. Happy to be safe.	3. Three trees fell on my &amp;lt;a href="http://evespeeves.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/trees-down/">mom's&amp;lt;/a> block in Flushing. She has lots of support nearby. They've lost some power.

I live in a high-rise in mid-town. The building swayed for hours, and it was exhausting and scary. One of the windows blew open, and it was a bitch to get it closed. But at 11PM or so the winds just stopped, and it's stayed quiet outside ever since. Got a great night's sleep. Power is on. Very fortunate. 	5. The streets in Manhattan are virtually empty. Some cabs, cars. Lots of emergency vehicles.	6.

All is good.Climate change	To partisans: The issue isn't whether Romney wanted to kill FEMA, it's that we're having an election without climate change as an issue.		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/29/change.jpg" width="384" height="368" border="0" alt="A picture named change.jpg">	It should be the &amp;lt;i>dominant&amp;lt;/i> issue.	As usual, people want to blame the leaders, but we get as much &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/october/recognizingBullshit">bullshit&amp;lt;/a> as we demand from them.

But the new version of the firehose is a mere trickle compared to the former raging torrent. 	This put me in a bad place because I depend on a gush of NYT headlines in my river. I could subscribe to all the feeds I could find, but that means that I'd get duplicate stories because the Times, like other pubs, runs many stories in multiple feeds. 	I've always been thinking about doing a heuristic to fix this. I'd keep track of the titles that had already appeared in a river and skip duplicates. Last night during the Giants game I gave it a shot, and it worked. 	I wrote the change up in &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.scripting.com/october2012/102712ByDw/river2NoRepeats">this worknote&amp;lt;/a>.	I added a huge number of feeds to the NYT river. And it's starting to feel good again. I wanted to share this as a possible best-practice for other aggregator developers.	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule level="1" to="1">			&amp;lt;font-weight>bold&amp;lt;/font-weight>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	Updates 		After running for a few hours -- success. &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=nyt">The NYT river&amp;lt;/a> is back to its rich flow, at a time when there's lots going on -- the presidential election and a hurricane. And there aren't any duplicates. All is good. :-)		It's been a while since I really looked at the NYT river. They write such good descriptions. You have a pretty good idea what the article is about even without clicking. Much more useful than getting full text. Because I get a breadth of the news, and the experience is created by editors who know what they're doing.	Pointers		Pointers: &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=nyt">NYT river&amp;lt;/a>. 		NYT feeds &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/index.html">page&amp;lt;/a>. 		The OPML &amp;lt;a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/36518280/readingLists/nytRiver.opml">reading list&amp;lt;/a> for the NYT river.A social network's soul	How to tell if a social network has soul? 	How often do the founders' tweets get retweeted. How often do their names pop up in your stream, not as ads of course, but because someone thought they were worthy of a pass-along.	In that spirit, I realized the other day that:	1. I never see tweets from Ev or Biz, two of the three founders of Twitter.		Of course today someone &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lindsaydavies/status/262297201018040320">RT'd Ev&amp;lt;/a>. 		It always works that way!		To show I'm a good sport, I RT'd the RT. :-)	2. I do sometimes see tweets from Jack, the other founder, and they're often &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/262204591519715328">useful&amp;lt;/a>. 	I don't use Facebook or Google-Plus, but even if so, I would imagine from time to time I'd see things linked from Vic Gundotra or Zuck. And the other day I &amp;lt;i>did&amp;lt;/i> see &amp;lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/26/3558086/nexus-10-camera-photos-vic-gundotra">something&amp;lt;/a> from Vic. The only times I ever see something from Zuck is if there's a shitstorm over privacy and he has to write an open post to try to calm people down. But it should be a constant drumbeat. And not something synthetic. They should be &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html">NBBs&amp;lt;/a>. But no network yet has figured out that they need NBBs at the helm. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/27/julia.gif" width="140" height="449" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named julia.gif">This epiphany comes after an embarassingly large number of years using social networks. 	Back in the days of &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CB_Simulator">CB Radio&amp;lt;/a> on Compuserve, which was very much like Twitter believe it or not, the Compuservants (people who worked at the company) never used the service. In fact they referred to us as the Lonelyhearts Club (I knew this because I had a personal friend who worked there and heard about it over the phone, not on the network). Compuserve is long-gone.	Whatever you may say or think about Scoble, he is retweeted. He works tirelessly to push new ideas out there. Any network should kill to get him on board. Pay him huge bucks. Wine and dine him. But they're so clueless they seem to resent him. Eventually this will flip around, and guys like Scoble will be seen as the equiv of NBA stars or American Idol winners. They are the reason people come to the service. If you're starting one of these networks you would do well to entice him. 	What made me think about this is that Hugh MacLeod, the famous Gaping Void artist-blogger, told me that Scoble had told him he should be using Instagram as his social network. I agree, up to a point. But Instagram never sought out Hugh. And Instagram doesn't have feeds, so I can't plug Hugh's content into my flows. So bzzzt, I veto Scoble on this one. But he was 80 percent right. Instagram is a good choice for what Hugh does, if they 1. gave a shit and 2. let the data flow. 	I think eventually the artists will rise and take all this over. Sandy's message	It just occurred to me, reading an &amp;lt;a href="http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/27/14727124-sandy-is-set-to-deliver-potential-election-surprise?lite?ocid=twitter">NBC article&amp;lt;/a> on how Hurricane Sandy might effect the election, that climate change will be an election issue after all. 	We may not want to discuss climate change, but our planet does.Lost Twitter connection	I am unable to send &amp;lt;a href="http://links.scripting.com/">links&amp;lt;/a> from my linkblogging tool to Twitter.	This outage started at 5:45PM Eastern yesterday. The last four of my links didn't go through. The reply from Twitter is empty. There's no error message or error code. 	The first three links were about Hurricane Sandy. The fourth was about the election. 	I've tried re-authorizing the account with Twitter, but that didn't seem to make a difference. The response is still empty. Nothing is posted to my Twitter account. 	If you have any clues what else I might try, I'm happy to. It's possible something changed in the Twitter API that I am not aware of. 	It's also possible this is the end of the road, that for some reason they've decided that my contribution is no longer wanted. 	I'll save any editorializing until there's more info. :-)	&amp;lt;b>Updates&amp;lt;/b>		I posted a &amp;lt;a href="https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/12119">note&amp;lt;/a> on the Twitter Dev discussion board.		Got a pointer to this &amp;lt;a href="https://github.com/themattharris/tmhOAuth/issues/94">issue&amp;lt;/a>, which seems to have happened about the same time.

And that changed the world.	Could the United States collapse too? 	What if it already has?	What if the change in the way the press works is the equivalent of a new political system, with a new division of power.	Isn't that what happened in the Soviet Union?Listening is Hard	The constant theme of my blog is the title of this post -- Listening is Hard. 	It is.	The way people read on the Internet usually has nothing to do with listening. What people seem to do mostly is skim the article looking for their own name, the name of someone they hate, or if neither of those turn up, they look for a key word or phrase that's linked to one of their canned schpiels. There are some notorious commenters here, people who make me groan when I see their names. I know what I'm going to hear has nothing to do with the topic of the piece. In the worst cases they just pick up a rant almost verbatim from The Ed Show or O'Reilly, and repeat it word for word. Nothing could be more boring. I usually turn those people off when I'm flipping through channels. I totally don't want them here on my blog, by proxy.	How you can tell if you're not listening? Here are some clues:	1. The person you think you're listening to tells you that you're not. They might be wrong, but before you dismiss them out of hand, consider the possibility that they're right. And use the scientific method. Read the actual words they have written. Not the story you hear in your own head when you read those words. Read &amp;lt;i>their&amp;lt;/i> words. 	2. If you find yourself hearing someone familiar talking through them, you're not listening. For example, if the thought forms in your head that "he is just like my brother" or mother or father, or former best friend -- someone you have issues with -- then you're not listening. There's absolutlely no doubt. Classic clue that you're projecting. Instead take a deep breath, look at your surroundings, then look back at the screen. It's just a screen. Not the family kitchen table when you were growing up. Your abusive parent isn't berating you. It's just some bits on a screen. :-)	3. Try this &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/03/03/DonsAmazingPuzzle.html">puzzle&amp;lt;/a>. Most people don't get the right answer. I didn't. I was amazed. That's another proof that listening is hard. If you can't count the letters, what are the chances that you've actually heard what someone is saying by skimming their story on the net.	4. Read this &amp;lt;a href="http://embracingtheabsurd.blogspot.com/2012/10/its-not-always-about-you.html">piece&amp;lt;/a>. See how bad inference can be. 99 times out of 100 it's not about you. So don't respond as if it were.		&amp;lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/b6UAYGxiRwU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	5. A famous editor hated me for a long time, but then all of a sudden one day started being nice to me. This kept going on long enough that we've now had a discussion about why he hated me so much. It's the old inference thing. I was saying "Sources Go Direct." I wasn't saying that I &amp;lt;i>wanted&amp;lt;/i> sources to go direct, or that editors deserved to be routed around (although as a matter of fact I did, and mostly do). But that wasn't what I was saying. I was saying that if you're in the publishing business, in any way, you have to realize that the lower cost of production and distribution has radically changed the way things work. You must factor that in. Hating me won't change anything. And if you actually listen to what I'm saying (there's the rub again) I say over and over that I &amp;lt;i>want&amp;lt;/i> professional journalists to make the transition. But you can't make the transition by clinging to a system that has gone away.	6. Another clue is that the topic is something that you find repulsive. Most people can't listen to topics that disgust them. For example, if I say that the OWS people missed huge opportunities because they didn't listen, if you support OWS, you're going to likely respond with a story that's orthogonal. I know this because it happens every time. But isn't it better to hear about the missed opportunity, esp when it's not too late, because then you don't have to miss it? To me, this is like a programmer who argues with a bug report. Why? If you listen, you can fix it. Good programmers do not argue with bug reports. And good revolutionaries are always looking for ways to be more effective at revolution. Dilbert-like revolutionaries insist on telling you why you don't get it. Don't be a Dilbert-like revolutionary. Nothing is more pathetic.	Now let's see if anyone who comments has actually listened to what I said! :-)Why Obama Now	&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/U9G8XREyG0Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>Sharing and mobile sites	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/26/disneypad.gif" width="145" height="181" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named disneypad.gif">Let's say I'm using my iPad and I come across a video, and click the link, watch it and decide to share it with my followers on Twitter. 	Something not-so-good happens. The mobile link goes to everyone. Whether they're using a mobile device or not. 	Mobile is about at the same place where we were with RSS when we realized that subscription wasn't just a matter of giving someone the URL to the RSS feed. We had to do more. Unfortunately we couldn't get everyone to swing in the same direction, so the problem was never adequately solved.	The correct answer here is to have a link on the page that goes to a shareable version of the page. I might be on the mobile version, but this will take me to the "general" or default version of the page. Then if someone comes to the page on an iPad or some other supposedly limited device, they can show them the mobile version, if they must.	This happens often enough to be something we need to fix, soon -- before it becomes an unsolvable problem.Olbermann don't sell out!	&amp;lt;i>If you know Keith Olbermann please send him a pointer to this.

I think this would be a serious mistake. You have a popular Twitter feed. And lots of fans. You could very easily start something on the Internet and keep all the profits for yourself, and run your own show, and if you pissed someone off that would be &amp;lt;i>good&amp;lt;/i> because it would get more people to watch and/or listen.	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/25/dewey.gif" width="145" height="109" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named dewey.gif">I used to think creating an Internet-distributed radio show was hard, but it's not.

It wasn't caused by the attack in Benghazi or the weak economy. 	It's time to lay the blame squarely where it would belong if we elect Mitt Romney president.	It's the American people's fault. 	We have been disclaiming our power for far too long. It's become habitual. And it's wrong.

If we increased voter turnout, we the people, not some campaign or political party, or paranoid focus group like Christians or the Tea Party, if ordinary Americans of all political persuasions got together and decided that voting matters -- then get this -- voting would matter. It might even inspire a candidate like Obama to trust us, a little, and start telling more truth about things like cyber-terrorism and climate change.

According to his plan the new domed &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Dodgers_proposed_domed_stadium">stadium&amp;lt;/a>, designed by Buckminster Fuller, would go at a &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Terminal">transportation hub&amp;lt;/a>, where &amp;lt;i>nine&amp;lt;/i> subway lines and the Long Island Railroad come together, in Brooklyn. 	He was opposed by the great highway builder and destroyer of urban ecosystems, &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses">Robert Moses&amp;lt;/a>, who &amp;lt;a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1133383/index.htm">wanted&amp;lt;/a> to build a new stadium at the &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Flushing+Meadows+Corona+Park,+New+York,+NY&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=40.697488,-73.979681&amp;sspn=1.029717,0.955811&amp;oq=Flushing+Meadow&amp;t=v&amp;hq=Flushing+Meadows+Corona+Park,+New+York,+NY&amp;z=14">confluence&amp;lt;/a> of three super-highways he was building, at Flushing Meadows, in Queens. 	O'Malley got his new stadium -- in Los Angeles. And Moses got his &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_Stadium">stadium&amp;lt;/a> and a new team, the Mets, to play in it. The Beatles famously &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles_at_Shea_Stadium">performed&amp;lt;/a> there in 1965. They tore the stadium down in 2009, and built a more modern one, with restaurants and fancy skyboxes, in the parking lot of the old stadium.		My Wikipedia bio incorrectly says I grew up in Brooklyn. I grew up in Queens, within walking distance of Shea Stadium. I come from a family of Dodgers fans, who instantly converted to the Mets in 1962. O'Malley was blamed for moving the Dodgers, but few at the time knew of the role Moses played in the story.	Fast-forward to 2012, and a new sports arena has risen in Brooklyn, at the exact location favored by O'Malley. Fans won't drive to events at this stadium. Moses must be rolling over in his grave. Gradually the city is adjusting to the future it should always have had. And Brooklyn is on the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/nyregion/islanders-to-move-from-brooklyn-to-long-island.html">rise&amp;lt;/a> again!

Why not systematize it? They have a feed for every service. And my aggregator produces a fairly usable readout, imho of course. :-)	So I wrote a script to pull out all the feeds from the Amazon page, and loaded them into &amp;lt;a href="http://quick.newsriver.org/">River2&amp;lt;/a> running on one of my servers (hosted at Rackspace, so it won't go down when Amazon goes down), and started running.

A segment of one of their server facilities, in Virgina, went out. This caused a large number of scripting.com sites to go offline. A couple of hours into the outage, I relocated my &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/">threads&amp;lt;/a> site to another server and started taking notes here. I was also posting tweets, some of which are &amp;lt;a href="http://outagetweets.blorkmark.com/">included here&amp;lt;/a>. &amp;lt;/i>	Heh. I realized that now that everything I have is in the worldoutline, it's remarkably easy for me to move a whole website from one server to another. It took two minutes to do the tech work, and it'll probably take as much as 20 minutes for the DNS change to propogate. But we're now back on the air, somewhat, and I can document the Amazon outage and its effects here, where I should have always have been able to. 	I also have to hook up the static home page. &amp;lt;i>Done.&amp;lt;/i> 	One thing I'm going to have to do is export the roots list on each server to OPML so that I can automate the movement of the content on one server to another.

It doesn't happen on any other device I've tried, and it works well on desktops and laptops. Works great on my iPod and iPad. Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/22/scrunchedScripting.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a> that illustrates.	2. I needed to create another Windows server on Rackspace, but they're no longer offering Windows Server 2003 images. So I had to go with 2008. The user interface is fairly different, but I've been able to puzzle it out. One thing I haven't figured out is how to access the web server on the machine over the Internet. The IP address that Rackspace gave me appears not to work.  		Update: The problem turns out that I have IIS running on the machine. I should have figured this out for myself, but it took a Rackspace support engineer to find this for me. Now I have to figure out how to turn it off. 		I have turned off IIS, which required two tries (one to quit, it and one to disable it after it relaunched after a reboot).		Now I am able to access the server on the local machine using its external IP address, but am not able to access it from my desktop using that address, &amp;lt;a href="http://orlando.scripting.com/">orlando.scripting.com&amp;lt;/a>.		Update #2: This time it was a firewall problem. You not only have to open port 80 for IIS (which was the default setting) it has to be &amp;lt;a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/creating-an-inbound-custom-allow-rule-for-windows-firewall-windows-2008">opened&amp;lt;/a> for all other apps running on the server. It was blocked. Thanks to the excellent Rackspace support for their quick help. They should change their name to Rockspace. :-)I named my company UserLand	Back in the 90s, before everyone was blogging, when I wanted to explain what we were doing, I would say this line and watch people's faces. 	"I named my company UserLand." 	It's actually a very powerful statement. It makes people think.	I mention it today, because at lunch yesterday at Startup School, for a while I was talking with a small group of UX engineers, one of whom had read my piece about users, and wanted to know if it was really okay if he kept using the U-word, because after all it's the first letter of his job description. These people love users and love what they do, and they don't want to stop.	Being the graybeard avuncular type, and being a UX guy myself, I gave them permission to continue to use the word as long as they kept loving the users. As soon as they didn't love them, they'd either have to quit and do something else, or stop using the term. If you use the word without love, it's a very harsh word, and unfair. But if you use it with love there's no higher honor than being called a user.Uber strikes out at JFK	The CEO of &amp;lt;a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/uber-2">Uber&amp;lt;/a>, Travis Kalanick, did a great presentation yesterday at &amp;lt;a href="http://startupschool.org/">Startup School&amp;lt;/a>. So great, that I decided I wanted to try the service, first chance I could when I got into JFK on my trip back to NY. 	So I set up a new account, entered my credit card info, installed the software on my iPad and my iPod Touch, and read a few docs that explained that it was not possible to arrange for a pickup in advance, that I would have to request the ride from the location where I was to be picked up. 	So here's what I did when I got to the front of &amp;lt;a href="http://www.jfk-airport.net/terminal-7.html">Terminal 7&amp;lt;/a> at JFK at about 4:30PM today.	1. Opened the Uber app on my iPod, but it thought, for some reason that I was in the middle of Kansas. So that wasn't going to work.	2. I got out the iPad, and it knew where I was (it has GPS, apparently the iPod doesn't). 	3. I got a confusing dialog that seemed to be asking me to choose which kind of ride I wanted. Either an SUV, or a Uber-x, or a regular ride. Too many choices.	4. Then the moment of truth. A nice big button that you click to request a ride. The caption below it says the nearest car is 9 minutes away. I click the button. Expecting to be congratulated with a map that showed me where my car was so I could watch it come to me! But nooooo...	5. A big error dialog comes up saying that before I can order I ride I have to have my phone number verified. Why didn't they have me do it at the hotel. I'm standing in front of a busy terminal, with people rushing around me, and I'm supposed to do what? So I get out my cell phone, and do what they tell me to do. Text the word "GO" to a number they specify.	6. Now I'm juggling three different devices. And my luggage, and remember the nearest car is 9 minutes away. And there are cabs coming and going, any one of which would be happy to take me home. 	7. I try clicking the big button again, on the iPad, but again I get the error message. You have to text to this number blah blah. 	8. I look at the cell phone, and there's an error that says the number isn't registered with Uber. At this point I guess that my phone has identified itself by its T-mobile number, not the Google Voice number that I registered with Uber. I can never remember the T-mobile number (there's no need to, no one but Google Voice knows it). I figure maybe I'll go to the Uber site and register with that number instead of my real number. 	9. So I get the iPad out and go to the Uber site. But I don't remember my password (I used my Macbook Air last night to fill out all the forms). 	10. So I open up Gmail, and start to search for the password and at this point I realize I've given it my best shot, and close everything up and get in a cab, give him my address and he takes me home.	And I was so excited to try the service! Oy.	If anyone from Uber reads this -- validating the number is something I should have been asked to do when I was setting up the account, not when I'm standing on the street wanting to go home. Do VCs ever spot the new thing	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/21/ipodTouch.gif" width="125" height="252" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named ipodTouch.gif">One topic that kept coming up &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/october/isNumberOneTheOnlyOne">yesterday&amp;lt;/a> is how do VCs spot the next big thing to invest in.	If there are only going to be 15 big companies spawned in every generation, how does the VC spot them?	I kept thinking of our experience trying to convince VCs in the late 90s that there would be a market for self-edited websites, the category that would eventually become blogging and lead to the market leaders of today.	I would demo our software to VCs, showing them how they could update their own websites. They asked why would they want to do that? I thought it was self-evident. We were turned down. So I tried again with the idea being that their assistants, without any technical knowledge could edit their websites. Again, they didn't see the need. I came back with RSS, again -- why would anyone want that? The theory was that there would be three main websites, and they thought they would be Excite, Yahoo and maybe Google. Amazon and eBay in commerce. And that was about it. 	I think if the VCs look at what they actually do vs what they say they do, they'll see they're more like the movie industry. Funding a lot of ideas, without any clue which ones will be big hits. That suggests that the YCombinator approach is more viable. And I gotta say I &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/05/31/astudioinsiliconvalley.html">argued&amp;lt;/a> for that in the 90s, and was told (again) that I was hallucinating. I should have taken that as a compliment. :-)	And I'd look for more creative people making the decisions about what gets funded. Trying to get breakthrough ideas through the finanical guys who have been the gatekeepers, is a very inefficient process.Is Number One the only one	Yesterday's &amp;lt;a href="http://startupschool.org/">Startup School&amp;lt;/a>  provided much food for thought, and possibly a few blog posts.	To start, &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Horowitz">Ben Horowitz&amp;lt;/a>, a principal at the VC firm &amp;lt;a href="http://a16z.com/">Andreessen Horowitz&amp;lt;/a>, says there's only room for one product in any tech category. If you end up as number two, you'll end up going out of business.	I wondered if that was true, and if so -- why is tech so special. 	He offered &amp;lt;a href="http://www.sybase.com/">Sybase&amp;lt;/a> as an example. He said it was an excellent database, but it was number two and eventually Oracle came to dominate. Does anyone still use Sybase?	But in many consumer categories there are plenty of number two's -- Avis to Hertz. Pepsi to Coke. The Rolling Stones to the Beatles. &amp;lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586">Ries and Trout&amp;lt;/a> in all their &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+netbook">books&amp;lt;/a>, talk about there being three rungs on the ladder. One and two make most of the money, with one making far more than two. And three hangs on, barely.	Then I thought about it some and realized there are quite a few examples in tech where no single product dominates.	In web browsers there's Chrome, MSIE, Firefox, Opera. 	In mobile OSes there's iOS and Android.	In desktop OSes, there's Macintosh, Windows and Linux. 	In browser-based email there's Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo Mail.	Search has Google, Yahoo and Bing.Microsoft keeps blowing it	Windows 8 has a whole new user interface. Is there any demand for a Windows with a new user interface? Doubtful. &amp;lt;i>Extremely&amp;lt;/i> doubtful.	If they want to try out a whole new way of doing things, great -- go for it. But don't drag Windows along with it. Market it as a new product, so people who want it can buy it. If they don't believe anyone will buy it, or not enough people to create critical mass, then they really must know that they're not going to achieve critical mass by trying to force their current users, who may want new hardware, to switch to a new user interface. The fact that they wouldn't buy it if it were a separate product is a very strong clue. 	The sad thing is that they had a product that people reallly wanted, with Windows at its core, but they wouldn't let us have it. Netbooks. I know because I was one of those people. 	&amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+netbook">Netbooks were marvels&amp;lt;/a>. Little packages of a computer with a good-size hard drive, a fast-enough CPU to do the kinds of things people would eventually do with iPads. But Microsoft wouldn't let them make machines that had more than a certain size hard drive, or memory, and I assume screen resolution. Which meant that all the innovation and improvement had to take place in battery life. Which happened, until they reached a level where more battery life was irrelevant. The price was truly awesome, you could buy a lot of computer in a very small package, that had wifi built in, for less than $300. At the time this was more than amazing, it was a breakthrough.	Microsoft, which was already facing the Apple juggernaut, had a unique product that people wanted, before the iPad, and they wouldn't let it evolve. Instead they wanted to force people to want a product they didn't -- more upscale Windows laptops that were heavier, had less battery life, and were serious investments at $1000. The netbooks were like popcorn. The were people's &amp;lt;i>third&amp;lt;/i> computers, not even second. They should have subsidized those babies, created a huge installed base, encouraged software developers to target this platform, and let the manufacturers move where ever they wanted. And btw, they could have laid off half their engineers, because the OS just has to keep doing what it has been doing all along, nothing more. Faster, on new hardware. And that's all. 	These products would have still had to have dealt with the iPad, and who knows, they might still have been wiped out, but the way Microsoft forced them to be anemic and non-improving, they didn't stand a chance against Apple. They were sitting ducks.	Now, they don't have too many options left, but they still have a cash cow. And if they insist on trying out whole new UIs, then do it, but let Windows become a quiet reliable and invisible platform, and do experimentation elsewhere. 	Another way to look at it, the people who wanted rock and roll left Windows a long time ago. The people who are left really don't want to think about Windows. Maybe they want to buy some new hardware. And along with that they get a whole new way of doing things. Bzzzt. Wrong move. Morning in America	Reagan had a great ad in 1984 that was so good we remember it now, so many years later.	&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4nUDg-O93GU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	But that was &amp;lt;i>Obama's&amp;lt;/i> Morning in America ad, in 2012, that is in every way as moving as Reagan's. They should run this, a lot, in the next couple of weeks.Romnesia	Look at all the women watching the President bring a new word into our vocabulary.	&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8BBEXB1Wf9c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	BTW, Romnesia is a good response to the Romneys calling the President a child. 	Okay you call me a child, I'll say you're crazy. 	Watch the Romneys come back to say Obama is not respectful enough. I'm okay with Romney winning	If Romney wins, I'm okay with it, because Obama has run a decent campaign, and a mostly honest one. And if people prefer Romney, then we deserve what we get. And I think it'll be really radical. There's a huge difference in direction for us based on who wins this election. 	I think we understand now that Romney doesn't stand for anything. He doesn't even understand the idea of having a political cause worth fighting for. He isn't pro-life or pro-choice. He doesn't want to do anything in particular. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://bloatware.org/">&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/10/19/bloatersmall.gif" width="135" height="206" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named bloatersmall.gif">&amp;lt;/a>Once elected he will revert back to what he was in the primary. I think his choice of Ryan as VP cemented that. I think Ryan will run the Presidency as much as Cheney did. He's got the support in Congress. The only hope against that is if the Democrats keep the Senate, and if they refuse to deal with the Republicans with the same tenacity that the Republicans refused to work with Obama. But I wouldn't hold my breath for that. There are Democrats from red states in the Senate, who might not want to take the chance of crossing the Republicans, assuming they hold the White House and the House.	I think you'll see the Ryan budget pass, pretty quickly -- if Romney wins. 	I read about this in a &amp;lt;a href="http://nymag.com/news/politics/elections-2012/obama-romney-economic-plans-2012-10/">great piece&amp;lt;/a> by Jonathan Chait at New York Magazine. 	The flipside is also true. Even if Obama loses both houses of Congress, his veto power will be all he'll need to radically rewrite the budget in his own image, because of the wonderful "fiscal cliff" that's coming up. 	In order to raise taxes and drastically cut the military budget (and profits to the defense industry, a Repulbican patron), he has to do exactly &amp;lt;i>nothing.&amp;lt;/i> Just kick back and watch the Republicans set their hair on fire. It'll be a thing to behold. Can Obama resist making a deal with them for a while, just for the fun of watching them get a dose of their own tactics? 	This cliff is nowhere near as dangerous as the one the Repubs pushed us to the brink of in August 2011. It's a good time to call their bluff. Especially after winning the election he wasn't supposed to win. :-)	I'm not saying either scenario plays out, but I'm okay with either. 		1. We get what we deserve.		2. The Repubs get what they deserve. Do you love Silicon Valley	I'm writing this from &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=mountain+view,+ca&amp;hnear=Mountain+View,+Santa+Clara,+California&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;z=12">Mountain View&amp;lt;/a>, in the heart of Silicon Valley.	I first came here in 1979. I drove a beat-up old van from Madison. I went via &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon">Eugene&amp;lt;/a>, where I had a friend from school, and drove down the coastal route. The brakes on the van failed, on El Camino, &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Mountain+View,+CA&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=37.384821,-122.0854&amp;spn=0.036896,0.065317&amp;sll=37.269174,-119.306607&amp;sspn=9.454681,16.721191&amp;oq=mountain&amp;hnear=Mountain+View,+Santa+Clara,+California&amp;t=m&amp;z=14">near&amp;lt;/a> Castro St. That's how I ended up staying at a huge campus-like temporary apartment community before moving to the hills &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Chemeketa+Park,+CA&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.384821,-122.0854&amp;sspn=0.036896,0.065317&amp;oq=chemeke&amp;hnear=Chemeketa+Park&amp;t=m&amp;z=15">outside&amp;lt;/a> Los Gatos.	I had mixed feelings about the Valley then. It was a burn-out, everyone worked all the time, or so it seemed. It wasn't like school where there was a mix of fun and work. And I ended up staying until 2003, almost 25 years. There were lots of ups and downs. It didn't take long to rise to the top, that was the good thing. But there wasn't much substance to the place. Sometimes I wonder if I wouldn't have done better climbing ladders in a comfortable east coast job. Might have left me more plugged-in at the age of 57, which is where I am now. 	I feel a lot of resentment from this place. I don't think they like me -- at all. I have what have become extreme ideas, but which in the beginning were the norm. That computers are tools of self-expression. That users are supremely important. When I came here I doubt if anyone had thought of running an ad on a computer screen as a way of supporting development. That didn't come until much later, after a few booms and busts.	These days when a young tech person comes here, there's all kinds of structures that didn't exist when I arrived. There were angel investors and VCs, but nothing like the various incubators that take applications and have "classes" and graduates. I'm sure I would have liked those, but I wonder if they would have taken me in.	I recently met a writer-in-residence at a famous university who said I should have no trouble landing a job in academia teaching young people how to do what I do. I encouraged her to give it a try at her school. Nothing happened. For whatever reason, I doubt if I would now be accepted in these programs. Yet, if I look back at my career, much of it right here in the Valley, it seems something would have been lost. Which is how I feel about my contributions now. Lots of missed opportunities. And maybe that's because the world isn't as open as it once was, and maybe that was the strength of Silicon Valley that has been lost. In 1979 there was a way for me to get involved. 	So I put this question out there, esp to young people who feel brilliant and driven to create real tools for personal expression, if there are any -- do you love this place? If not, where do you go? When I was young, this place was like Memphis or Nashville for country musicians, or Hollywood for actors or screen writers. Do you feel drawn to, and love for, Silicon Valley?Let's call them users	Every decade or so this &amp;lt;a href="http://jacks.tumblr.com/post/33785796042/lets-reconsider-our-users">question&amp;lt;/a> comes up. Why do we use that awful U-word to describe our users. It's hard to even formulate the question without sounding stupid. And every time the discussion comes up, it lasts a while before everyone gives up because there really aren't any better words, and this is the word everyone uses so what are you going to do.	Hey I called my second company &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software">UserLand Software&amp;lt;/a>, because I wanted to be clear who we were focused on. The idea was we would make a wonderful playground that we, as users, would love to er ahem -- use. And we'd make it easy enough to develop apps inside the land that developers and users would find they became the same people. Software made by users for users. This was a good idea, I felt.	Words are like formats. You could try to come up with a better version of RSS, for example -- but the old one won't go away, so now you have two formats where once there was just one. That's why I say that two ways to do something is worse than one way, no matter how much better the second way is than the first. It's like taking features out of products -- you really can't do it. The users will eventually make you put it back (that is if you pay any attention to them at all).	So rather than run away from the U-word (toward what exactly?) I decided to embrace it, fully -- and name the company UserLand. The idea caught on even if the company ultimately didn't make it. 	The answer is to love those users so much that they don't mind being called users. That's an art a lot of tech companies have yet to master. How to kick Twitter addiction	&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/17/twitterscreenfull.gif">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/17/twitterscreenstiny.gif" width="200" height="267" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 30px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 0; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named twitterscreenstiny.gif">&amp;lt;/a>Last night, a couple of hours before the debate, all of a sudden Twitter was radically transformed on my iPad. Previously it had appeared exactly as if I were accessing it on my desktop or laptop. This is as it should be, because the iPad has a full-size screen. And the compromises that designers make for "mobile" websites tend to fit much smaller screens, like an iPhone or Android smartphone. 	One might argue that this design is better than the full Twitter website, but that's unimportant, because no one asked me if I wanted a radical change, especially at a time like this -- just before a historic matchup that was going to be followed by all my friends on Twitter, in real-time, in a couple of hours.	There was no way around it, and no time to get adjusted. I didn't know how to use this interface. I'd click on things and get unpredictable responses from the software. All of a sudden, software that I had mastered was foreign to me. I had become a newbie, in an instant, because of a bug, or some product committee at Twitter, or perhaps the CEO of the company. &amp;lt;i>Someone&amp;lt;/i> decided that I would have to adjust, right now, with no warning, and no choice.	This is an awful way to do this. And it's even worse than the way Twitter treats developers (I know, since I am a developer as well as a user). 	The bright side is that I realize that I am addicted to Twitter, and the feelings I have about this are the same feelings I had when I was forced to quit smoking a few years ago. My skin feels itchy. My mind can't focus. I keep thinking "Just one more tweet, one more, and I'll be fine."	So I suppose I have to thank the folks at Twitter for helping me see how hopelessly addicted I am. And maybe, instead of making peace with this awful interface, I'll use it as a way to remind myself that this is not good. As if perhaps someone had replaced my Marlboro Lights with a menthol cigarette like Kool or Salem. Yuck. Tastes bad. Oh that's right this isn't good for me. Maybe it's time to quit?	BTW, the debate was excellent. I thought the President was fantastic. He told Romney that his bullshit is bullshit. Which made Romney nervous and he said some things he probably wishes he hadn't said. Finally someone stood up to the bully. Had I been able to tweet effectively this is basically what I would have said. The new River tab on Scripting	Today there is a &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=river">new tab&amp;lt;/a> on the Scripting News home page. &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/16/scriptingRiver.gif">Screen shot&amp;lt;/a>.	I've felt for a long time that every serious news organization and blog should have a river associated with their publication. The river would include the news sources that the publication "reads" -- to give their readers a sense of the community they both belong to and the community they define.	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/16/box.gif" width="145" height="151" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named box.gif">For example, a blog about a town would include a river of all the bloggers who are active in that town. This is a vital resource for the editorial people who write for the pub, but it also gives access to everyone. The readers get to read all the news sources, and the news sources get to read each other. Very quickly, probably instantaneously, all these different boxes, sources, readers, reporters merge into one, because truthfully it's more like that every day. The imaginary line that separates a columnist from a voter from a mayor is more or less non-existent, in a day when mayors have blogs, and citizens become mayors.	This is the world envisioned by at least some of the founders of the United States. That the people would form the government, and that the press would cover everything, without regard to status. The tendency of cliques and ladders to form would be counteracted by new entrants in all the fields, and lower barriers to entry. This is what democratization of media looks like. It's why I put my collection of rivers on a site called &amp;lt;a href="http://mediahackers.org/">Media Hackers&amp;lt;/a>. Because that's what all this is doing, hacking media, and turning it into something new, given the new realities of the technology we now use to publish and to read. 	Rivers are revolutionary because they are flat. The ideal level playing field. I read NakedJen and Doc Searls along with the New York Times and whitehouse.gov. And Jon Chait, David Frum, Felix Salmon and Matt Taibbi. I love them all because they send me fresh ideas that get me thinking. And I love that I can share all that with you, the lovely people who read my humble blog.	The river on Scripting News home page is a collection of feeds that I read to be inspired and to keep informed. They reflect my interests, which is appropriate because it is my blog. It helps you know who influences me, and I'm always open to adding more feeds to my river. 	My feeling is that if you read my blog you should also read my river. 	I think the more innovative sites should get on board right away. I have pitched FastCompany and Wired on doing this. Technology Review at MIT has written glowingly of the idea of rivers of news, how about putting one together for your community? BerkeleySide, why not put a river of Berkeley bloggers on your site? 	I am available to help any serious publication get started. We have the software, and the interest. And the community of users gathered around my site, ever-more-active, are zealots when it comes to spreading the gospel! :-)	PS: Thanks to Dody Gunawinata, a developer in Cairo, for helping get the flash out of my rivers. I'm still very much a Javascript newbie, and need help getting stuff like this to work smoothly.California trip	I can't remember my last trip to California. 	That's why it's time to spend a few days in Silicon Valley.	My trip begins on Wednesday and I return on Sunday. I'll be staying in Palo Alto and have one event on my calendar, the YCombinator &amp;lt;a href="http://startupschool.org/">Startup School&amp;lt;/a> at Stanford on Saturday. I'm not speaking or anything, just going to sit in the audience and listen. 	Let's see how things have changed in the valley of tech. :-)Obama's easy sell	For whatever reason, President Obama, has until now refused to sell.	It may be a little late to teach him salesmanship, but maybe that's what they're doing in his debate prep before the second debate tomorrow at Hoftstra.	The pitch is pretty easy:		1. If you elect me to a second term, ObamaCare will be deployed and finally after a hugely long struggle, the United States will have the &amp;lt;i>beginnings&amp;lt;/i> of health reform. It's not nearly everything we need to do, that will be something for a future president to tackle. For now, I promise to implement it. And that's a promise I can keep even with an obstructionist opposition party with a majority in the House.		2. In my first term we wound down the war in Iraq, and we're winding down the war in Afghanistan. I get how weary we all are of war. My opponent, a nice man for sure, will imho get us into another war in the Middle East, with another crazy country, Iran -- and this one, like the other two, will be hard to get us out of. We're probably looking at another 10 or 20 years before all this war is over. Another war in the Middle East is not what we want. I think we can manage this one without sending Americans in to fight and without bombing Iran. I think we can work this politically and economically, with the cooperation of our allies and even our adversaries. No one outside of a few crazy countries wants to see Iran with nuclear weapons.		3. Reproductive choices will remain with the people whose lives and bodies it concerns. None of us like abortion, but we have different views on what the correct moral choice is. As long as there is no consensus, and believe me there is not, we must stay with things as they are. You have to listen carefully to my opponent's words on this one. He says he won't pass legislation. But he also says he like Supreme Court judges like the ones who are prepared to overturn Roe v Wade. That means it's pretty likely if you elect him, that there will be a very serious changes to abortion rights.	There you have three totally pragmatic reasons why you should re-elect the President. You may not like the way he looks, you may think (incorrectly) that he's a radical leftist. You may have heard (again incorrectly) that he was not born in the US. But if you think you might get sick, and if you're weary of war, and if you might ever have a family member with an unwanted pregnancy, you really have to vote for Obama.	PS: I am an independent, I voted for Obama in 2008 and will vote for him this year. I've given his campaign $400 so far. However, I have still voted Republican more times than Democrat. So if you have a response to this post, I would appreciate if you took all this into account, and don't respond as if you're on Fox News and I'm one of the "liberals" they talk about. Thanks.Dark social web history	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/15/elephant.gif" width="125" height="90" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named elephant.gif">I read Alexis Madrigal's &amp;lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/dark-social-we-have-the-whole-history-of-the-web-wrong/263523/">piece&amp;lt;/a> about the Dark Web with a bit of sadness, in a way -- that so much time had passed with so much history being rewritten, and it's happening again. Not due to any malice, I'm sure. We all have the experiences we have. 	Madrigal was a teen during the huge initial growth of the web, and was an instant messenger, chatroom, ICQ and Usenet person. But in the blogging world, which was the precedent for Twitter and Facebook, we were constantly developing ways to surface the new and interesting content. Blogrolls, weblogs.com, RSS were all about that. And Live Journal had the social features of Facebook long before Facebook. 	Just saying I agree with Madrigal, but we're still waiting for a serious history of this stuff to be written so we're not all blind men looking at the elephant and discovering alternate theories about how it all came to be based on looking at this part or that.In 2016, a two-screen debate	In four years, let's have a debate where the candidates may if they want have a computer and access to the Internet. This would allow the candidates to post pointers to things that viewers could read while listening to the debate. 	By then most of us will be two-screen TV watchers. Why not let the debate happen on the second screen as well. 	I know this will seem like a radical idea, but in 2008 they were still time-delaying debates so people on the west coast saw them three hours after the east coast. There were probably just a few thousand people commenting on the debates in real-time. Now, what a difference. We've covered a lot of distance in just four years.He called the President 'boy'	Just tuned into a little of the Sunday morning news discussion on various networks. The big issue seems to be whether or not VP Biden was disrespectful of Congressman Ryan in the Wednesday debate. 	Yes he was. But I haven't forgotten what &amp;lt;a href="http://videocafe.crooksandliars.com/david/romney-obama-boy-who-doesnt-tell-truth">Mitt Romney said&amp;lt;/a> to President Obama. He said the President is like a boy who doesn't tell the truth. 	"Look, I've got five boys. I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it."	He called the President 'boy' -- to his face.	With 70 million witnesses.	There really isn't anything more offensive for a white man to say to a black man.	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4pxKTtyFzY">Watch the video&amp;lt;/a> a few times. I think this was far more outrageous than anything he said at the 47 percent dinner in May.		&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4pxKTtyFzY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	People complain about t-shirts at rallies worn by Romney fans.

But these days how much freedom can you enjoy without Internet access?	This question came up in my first year at Harvard, when the RIAA convinced the provost to suspend several students who they believed were sharing music with other students. They cut the students off from Internet access for a year. In 2003, this was considered too onerous, that it was equivalent to expelling them from school. We changed our mind, a good result. Now in 2012, those same students are fully adult, in the workforce, and suspending their Internet access is like expelling them from life itself. 	You think it will stop with music and film piracy? Heh. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came...">First they came&amp;lt;/a> for the communists, and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.	Ask not what the Internet can do for you, ask what you can do for the Internet.	See also: &amp;lt;a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2012/10/14/violate-copyright-no-facebook-for-you/">Violate copyright?

I can hold it in front of my eyes while lying down without any strain. So it's great for watching movies. I'm watching a &amp;lt;a href="http://video.pbs.org/video/2288869682/">Frontline special&amp;lt;/a> about the choice between Obama and Romney. It's in HD, and the iPod does a great job with HD video. 	The screen is large enough to read and write. My eyes aren't so great. So I haven't been able to use earlier iPhones for email or reading web sites. Maybe in an emergency. But I much prefer to use my iPad -- more screen real estate. But this one is different. I set up all my apps there, and used them -- and I think I will continue to do so.	I know other people love to look at and hold their iDevices, but I've never felt that way -- until this one. It really is beautiful and light. The five years of work on this product really show. It feels like it's the size of one of the smaller iThings, but it has all the power of an iPhone, minus the phone (which I truly do not need).	When I travel I will now have four computers with me:		1. My iPad with LTE.		2. My Macbook Air.		3. My Nexus Whatever (I forget what model it is).		4. My iPod Touch, blue. 	It was only $299 plus tax. I feel like it was a total bargain.	I thought at first that the earbuds would work in my ears, but not when I'm walking. They still fall out every few steps. I think when my ears warm up they cause the buds to slip out. So far the only buds that work for me are the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-J10-Headphones-Non-Slip-Design/dp/B000092YR6/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=3ON5W8HBTKUOI&amp;coliid=I2FB0YPIZHAEQQ">$8 Sony's&amp;lt;/a>. So the Apple buds go into my upper-right desk drawer along with all my other unused Apple stuffff.	I also like that Apple got me to buy something that wasn't a replacement for something I already had. Some people like buying shoes. I used to like buying stereo equipment. 	Finally, click the thumb below to see a full-size pic of the iPod itself.		&amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/8086244801/in/photostream/lightbox/">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/14/myIpodBlue.jpg" width="400" height="533" border="0" alt="A picture named myIpodBlue.jpg">&amp;lt;/a>My linkblog has an archive	The &amp;lt;a href="http://links.scripting.com/rss.xml">RSS feed&amp;lt;/a> for my linkblog, which goes back to December 2010, has a feature that I think no other RSS feed has (or Atom for that matter). Not only does it have an archive, but the feed itself describes the archive. It contains enough information so you could easily write a script that downloads all the content of my linkblog, in RSS.	1. If you look in the feed, look for the &amp;lt;microblog:archive> element. Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/13/archiveElementScreenShot.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a>.	2. I wrote a script that downloads the linkblog archive in full. Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/misc/mylinkblog/downloadLinkblogArchive.txt">text file&amp;lt;/a> containing the script. Here's the script as an &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/misc/mylinkblog/downloadLinkblogArchive.opml">OPML file&amp;lt;/a>, and as a .&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/misc/mylinkblog/downloadLinkblogArchive.ftsc">ftsc file&amp;lt;/a>. It's written in UserTalk, but could easily be converted to other scripting languages. 	2a. For fun, I pasted the script into the outline for this &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/october/myLinkblogHasAnArchive">blog post&amp;lt;/a>.

I'm learning that running a server, like a lot of things, requires a temperment that most people don't have -- no matter how much they may want to do it. But it would be great if these people had Radio2 accounts &amp;lt;i>somewhere.&amp;lt;/i> Then we could develop utilities to download their archives locally. This is a lovely little project I've been meaning to get to. If we had some users who needed it, it would actually make it easier to write.	Anyway, all this is preamble to this question -- If you're already running a Radio2 server, would you be willing to let someone else virtually crash on your couch? Radio servers probably can host several hundred users, if not more. It's a pretty lightweight server app.	Anyway, reply here with a comment if you already have a server and are willing to volunteer for this. 	I think it can be a good experience for everyone.New iPod Touch shipping?	I find myself wanting to buy a new iPod Touch. 	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097BEF1S/ref=s9_simh_gw_p422_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0TX1NMG6259BCSC1ZSC9&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1389517282&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/12/ipod.gif" width="101" height="232" border="0" alt="A picture named ipod.gif">&amp;lt;/a>	The blue one of course.	I wonder if it's showing up at retail yet?Catching up on OPML &amp; RSS stuff	Lots of things happening in the Land of OPML these days. 	1. At first I thought I wouldn't be able to provide full text descriptions and good titles to Google Reader people. But as often happens, after a night's sleep, and with the conversations with readers fresh in my mind, I figured out how to, step by step &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/october/aReprieveForGoogleReaderReaders">get there&amp;lt;/a>. 	2. Then last night, just before the debate, I had a bit of time, and wanted to see if I couldn't get a link to the OPML itself into the RSS feed. This is something I had working in the previous version of the feed. 	3. It proved a little difficult, so then I realized I could do something even better -- I could put the &amp;lt;i>OPML itself&amp;lt;/i> right in the RSS feed. That way, if anyone wanted to provide a truly high fidelity view of the content of my blog, including the attributes that come with the OPML, and the full structure of the outlines, well, they wouldn't even have to read a file. So I did it. And it works. 		&amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/rss.xml">http://static.scripting.com/rss.xml&amp;lt;/a>	4. &amp;lt;a href="http://microliner.org/">Microliner&amp;lt;/a> was released. Quite a few people tried it. Everyone seems to like it so far. I find it fascinating. We can have a structured conversation that's something like the Instant Outliner and something like Twitter, but really not like anything I've seen yet. So I want to get a better feel for it, so today I'm going to add a community feature. 	5. There was a bit of drama on Wednesday night when it looked like Microliner had been shut off. But it turns out to have been a coincidence, that it was the same day that Twitter shut off some of the long-deprecated URLs in their REST interface. Quite a few other developers had to scramble to get their apps back online (we tend to forget about the code we wrote five years ago, esp if it continues to work without problems, as our Twitter code did). 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/12/jfk.gif" width="125" height="134" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named jfk.gif">6. As the &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.scripting.com/october2012/101112ByDw/unbreakingOurTwitter">dust was settling&amp;lt;/a> on this, I wondered why there isn't a brain-dead simple machine image I could set up that does a subset of what Twitter's API does, reliably, fast, and with no terms and conditions. It could at least serve as a sandbox for testing apps before they go live. And it might turn into a coral reef. I sent an email to Dan MacTough, who has become fluent in node.js, to ask him to have a look. By writing this, I'm inviting all readers of this site to think about it, and maybe do it. 		It also occurred to me that Twitter might want to sponsor the work. They've been very active in open source, and it would be a great way to show that they love the wild innovation of the open Internet. It might be a smart way to zig to their own zag. :-)		BTW, it's worth mentioning that the Bootstrap Toolkit, which came out of Twitter, and now is open source, came out early enough in the development process for the worldoutline software that we were able to get it in, at a very basic level. Every page rendered by the worldoutline, by default has the full toolkit available to it. That can lead to some pretty nice serendipity. 	7. If you can do it with tent.io, great. 	8. I'm still waiting for one of the alternate-Twitterverses to hook into my &amp;lt;a href="http://links.scripting.com/rss.xml">linkblog feed&amp;lt;/a>. The first one that does gets my full link flow, which is a nice little first step in what could be a wonderful bootstrap. It's my proposal to all developers for how I'd like to work with you. It's just &amp;lt;a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS&amp;lt;/a> with a &amp;lt;a href="http://walkthrough.rsscloud.org/">cloud&amp;lt;/a> element. You can even do it without using the cloud info (that's just for realtime-ness). 	Having a lot of fun. Finally we're getting some outliner users. That's a magic ingredient. Outliner people are smart and fair-minded, and love to think. Just the kind of users we like. :-)	One more thing that's worth saying every so often, esp since President Kennedy came up in the debate last night. Ask not what the Internet can do for you, ask what you can do for the Internet. Really. It's good for you. :-)Mr President, grow a pair	We all saw the debt-ceiling spectacle in the summer of 2011. The Republicans in Congress played an incredibly dangerous game of &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)">Chicken&amp;lt;/a> with the President. If either of them blinked at the wrong moment, the casualty would be American dominance of the world's financial system. 	Most Americans, and I would bet a lot of our representatitves, don't understand that it's not so much our military that gives us power around the world, rather it's the fact that our currency, the dollar, is the safe haven for all value, world-wide. If either the President or the Congress dropped the ball, that would have shattered, and we would stop being the exceptional country, and all kinds of bills would come due. Not for future generations -- right now. 	I was appalled when I saw the President take the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/us/politics/25legal.html">14th Amendment&amp;lt;/a> off the table early in the process. If you recall, the amendment contains a provision that says that the validity of the US debt will not be questioned. Clearly, there was no point debating whether we would honor our obligation. The Republicans can whine all they want. If they want to have an impeachment, the famously coool President would just look into the camera and say he was doing what the Constitution told him to do, and the Congress should get on board. They would still have to get the votes of 2/3 of the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm">Senate&amp;lt;/a>, and it was controlled by Democrats, so they can jump up and down all they want, nothing was going to change. 	Instead, our dreamy-eyed President decided to negotiate with them! He chose brinksmanship when we should have had some ballsy &amp;lt;i>leader&amp;lt;/i>ship. 	That's why his numbers dropped when he did the same damned thing in last week's debate. We were reminded why this President hasn't yet got the message. The Republicans are dicks. You can't deal with people like that as if they would respond to reason. &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=completely+wrong&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lQl2UM-pOYOB0AH9yoDwCw&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1229&amp;bih=1063">Romney&amp;lt;/a> made that clear from the outset. This debate should have been seen by the President as an opportunity to get something straight. 	"I am the fucking President of the fucking United States, and if you don't like that, fuck you."	Luckily there's still time for him to get a clue. 	This is not a negotiation with Congress or the Republicans, Mr. President. You are negotiating with your employers, the people of the United States of America. If this election were being held in August 2011, you would have lost. It's time for you to get the message, that we will not accept this kind of leadership in the future. 	You have my vote. And my money. But I'm glad that enough of my fellow Americans were willing to tell a pollster that you're too wimpy to be President. So maybe you'll get a clue and maybe in your second term we can get a bunch more stuff done. Or at least Washington will be a bit more quiet and let us get on with our lives, without having everything fall apart for no good reason.Unbreaking our Twitter	We got hit by a wave of deprecation on Twitter yesterday. 	First thing that happened (or so it appeared) is that &amp;lt;a href="http://microliner.opml.org/">Microliner&amp;lt;/a> stopped working. Since yesterday was rollout day for Microliner, it seemed that this was a response from Twitter to the edgy-ness of the app. We do display people's tweets as lines in an outline. But, we figured that maybe they'd see how interesting this project is and let it keep running. We're not trying to steal anything from them. The tweets were in response to ones generated by Microliner. So it's not as if we're trying to replace Twitter. But that was worth a shrug -- okay -- they don't want us to do it, so be it.	But later, Radio2 stopped working. That's much more serious because it's mission-critical. We use that software to keep an archive of everything we post to Twitter without having to depend on Twitter to provide one (they don't at this time). The only alternative would be to do all our tweeting inside Twitter. That would mean all my other uses for my linkblog would go away. Since that's a big part of the reason I do it, well -- there's no choice -- I would stop using Twitter.	But it turns out that none of this actually happened. Instead it was an unlikely coincidence. The very day that Microliner was released was also the day they turned off some parts of the API. I admit I wasn't paying attention to their deprecations. Figuring I'd cross the bridge when I came to it. If they shut us off that way, I'd decide at that time if I wanted to do the work to get it all working again. I really disapprove of platform vendors doing this. I think there are so many more of us than them, that they should stay compatible. But I don't get a say in this. And unless you work at Twitter, Inc, you don't either.	To Microliner users, many of whom are OPML newbies, to get the latest bits, choose &amp;lt;i>Update opml.root&amp;lt;/i> from the File menu. That should get it working again for you. 	Update: Here's the &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.scripting.com/october2012/101112ByDw/unbreakingOurTwitter">worknote&amp;lt;/a> that outlines the details. I was able to get &amp;lt;a href="http://docs.reallysimple.org/">Radio2&amp;lt;/a> and Microliner working again. Yehi! :-)	Update #2: I almost thanked Twitter. But that would be too &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">weird&amp;lt;/a>. Test post for Google Reader readers	The first version of my app that re-links my CMS with full content feeds had a serious encoding bug. 	This post has a &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/06/22/whatComesAfterBlogging.html">bunch&amp;lt;/a> of &amp;lt;a href="http://poets.worldoutline.org/">links&amp;lt;/a> to &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/06/14/10YearsNoSmokingDave.html">stuff&amp;lt;/a>. When you click the links, do they work?	That is, when you see this post in Google Reader. (I know it works in the browser.)	Here's a nice picture! Can you see it?		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/10/newAccordionGuy.gif" width="172" height="259" border="0" alt="A picture named newAccordionGuyBig.gif">	And a little &amp;lt;b>bold&amp;lt;/b> and &amp;lt;i>italic&amp;lt;/i> text. Does it look bold and italic?	If you want to help out, come to the &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/october/testPostForGoogleReaderReaders">threads site&amp;lt;/a> and drop in a comment.A reprieve for Google Reader readers	I hate to hear the stories of readers who will muddle along and keep reading even though they wish there was a way to get the full text of the stories in their choice of RSS tools. 	To be clear, the ones who threaten me can go now -- this is a labor of love over here, there's no money involved. You can be bitter or angry with me for not pleasing you, but it only makes me wish you'd go away, not that there was some way I could serve you better.	Anyway -- I figured out how I could patch up the feed after the fact, without unnecessarily intertwining software that I'm desperately trying to decouple. The saving grace was that each of my stories is also available in OPML. So I did what Google Reader could and never will do -- I get the OPML and converted it to HTML and replace the feed item description with that text. After creating a title from the description. 	Not a horrible klooge, and as I said it doesn't involve one piece of software knowing anything about the other, which was the goal. Cost -- 1/2 day -- so far. Let's see if it stays that small an investment. :-)Outline your Twitter conversations	I just released a tool called &amp;lt;a href="http://microliner.opml.org/">Microliner&amp;lt;/a> that lets you outline your conversations on Twitter.	I don't think anyone has ever had a tool like this, so I'd better explain how it works. 	1. Open up the Microliner Workspace window. Enter an idea. 140 characters or less, please. :-)	2. Click the Tweet button. It goes out to all your followers on Twitter.	3. Wait a minute or so. Click the Replies button. Microliner calls Twitter and gets the replies, and arranges them under the messages they are in response to. 	4. You can then reply to the replies, and so on. Once you get going, you can participate in a dozen conversations at once, and not lose track of where you are or who you're conversing with. It really works.	The tool is available now: &amp;lt;a href="http://microliner.opml.org/">http://microliner.opml.org/&amp;lt;/a>.	I thought I was done developing on Twitter as a platform, and then I get an idea like this, and I &amp;lt;i>have&amp;lt;/i> to do it, whether or not its advisable. :-)		&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UPw-3e_pzqU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>To Google Reader readers	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;line-height>135%&amp;lt;/line-height>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	As you may know, there's been a major redesign of the Scripting News &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/">home page&amp;lt;/a>. But, you may not be able to see that this is part of a much bigger change in the way I do content management, one which is being modernized to fit into the new realtime flow of links, pictures, podcasts, etc facilitated by Twitter, and what I hope will be a thriving ecosystem of feed-like apps that run outside of Twitter.	Things are changing, not just here but everywhere. And I'm moving quickly, and as this happens things break. 	Yesterday I posted three items to my feed that were just titles. This was a bug, in some provisional software that patched the new system to the old system. I'm not going to fix the bug because there's going to be a new way to do the feed, and I'm just one person programming here, and I can't afford the time to maintain provisional code. I have to be working on the main line. 	And here we have a choice -- continue to compromise for people who use Google Reader, which is a very fussy piece of software that doesn't play by the rules of RSS 2.0, or break Google Reader, just for this feed -- and do things the way the Twitterverse works, which imho is also the right way to do things. Obviously, given the way I phrased that, I'm going the way I feel is right.	The question is this -- must feed items have titles?	The answer is clearly no. No, because the RSS 2.0 spec says so and no because Twitter has built a wonderful ecosystem of communication around the idea that posts can be short enough to &amp;lt;i>be&amp;lt;/i> titles. How could you require a title to have a title? It would be ridiculous. 	I already have a great linkblogging tool called &amp;lt;a href="http://docs.reallysimple.org/">Radio2&amp;lt;/a> that takes blogpost-like items and turns them into an RSS 2.0 feed of Twitter-able items. It seems perfectly reasonable that Google Reader could adapt to make sense out of these feeds. It's just one piece of software. But they don't move, and that gives others a tough choice. To move anyway, knowing people who use Google Reader will be left behind, or continue to provide content as if Google Reader was the only way people were consuming it, when that isn't even close to being true anymore. 	I hate it when users are caught in the middle like this. You guys did nothing wrong other than use a piece of software that works for you. And of course since you want to read my site, I think that's fantastic. Maybe there will be some compromise possible, a way to accomodate everyone without making me, just one person, do the work that a big company like Google should be doing to support you, people who use their software. But right now that just can't happen. 	You will continue to get links to my stories in your input stream, I hope. But the full text will not be there. You can click the link to read them on my site, or skip it, or unsubscribe. And I'm sorry to be parting in this way, but we have to move forward, and it looks to me very much like Google Reader is behind us now. 	Here's how my new system works. 		1. I created a new Radio2 &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/09/newScriptingNewsCategory.gif">category&amp;lt;/a> called Scripting News. 		2. When I want an item to appear in the Scripting News feed, I just &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/09/scriptingNewsCheckbox.gif">check the box&amp;lt;/a> in the category list.		3. I click Post. When I do that, a bunch of processes are set in motion, including a callback script running on my server that copies the category feed to the location on S3 of the Scripting News feed, and pings our cloud server to tell it that we updated. It in turn notifies all services that have requested updates, and they read the feed. All this happens in a couple of seconds, at most.			An aside: One of the benefits of this switch is that all the effort that's been poured into feeds on Radio2 in the last couple of years now accrues to Scripting News. The feed not only has archives, but the archive is described in the feed itself, so apps can easily find it. Podcasting isn't an afterthought, it's fully supported, and not hacked in. And there's so much more.		4. One of those agents cross-posts to Twitter. That's how you see the link on Twitter, and it's why my content, that lives outside Twitter, is archived separately. I'm not waiting for Twitter to give me access to my links, since I never gave it up to them. 	This is also consistent with the philosophy of distributing pointers to the content instead of the content itself. That way there is a single archive for it, one authoritative copy of each bit, even though it can be referenced in many places. 	I've never been a fan of full content in feeds. I know some people feel it's the only way to go, but I don't agree, and never have. New scripting.com features	Two new features on Monday evening.	1. There's a new &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=archive">Archive tab&amp;lt;/a>. It links to the monthly archive pages back to April 1997. 	2. Now each tab has its own URL. So if you're coming to the site for the links, you can bookmark that tab and &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">go there&amp;lt;/a> directly. And there may be additional tabs in the future that you will want to bookmark.	Sometimes clicking on a tab causes a flash. If you have an idea what might cause that please leave a &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/october/newScriptingcomFeatures">comment&amp;lt;/a>. Thanks.	Thanks again to &amp;lt;a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tabs">Bootstrap&amp;lt;/a> for the great Javascript library. They taught outlining wrong	In school they taught us to outline first, then write from the outline. It's an ideal no one achieves, because it's impossible to have the essay arrive in finished form in our mind before we start writing. It doesn't work that way.	Instead we wrote the paper first, then the outline.	And that was correct, because it was the only way that worked. But it didn't get us much more than a slide show presentation of our work. It's different when you have a structure editor, an outliner. Because you can revise both the text and its organization after the initial burst of writing.	Here's how I do it today, in my outliner. I write from top to bottom. Then I review. If I find structure, I add it.	Then I have a structure to work with, I add more ideas become apparent, more things I have to record, to tell the reader. The order might change. The process of each little project is to iterate both the work product and the narration until I feel I'm ready to move on to the next thing. 	Of course I might start two or more things at the same time. For example I have two &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.scripting.com/october2012/10812ByDw/allMyCommentsInOpml">worknotes&amp;lt;/a> &amp;lt;a href="http://worknotes.scripting.com/october2012/10812ByDw/newSetUrlCommand">open&amp;lt;/a> now, and this blog post.	In a blog post I play with order more than structure. They are meant to be read from top to bottom, as a story.	But worknotes offer different things to different people. I write them for today's users and hopefully tomorrow's too. But I also write them for developers, including myself, who will continue to work on the code behind the notes. I find it very useful to be able to open my notes from a previous project, while working on something related, and find it all neatly organized, so I can skip right to the part that's relevent to me. 	I thought it would be interesting to take a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/08/worknotesoutlinetoday.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a> of my worknotes outline so you can see what projects in various states of completion look like. At the same time here's &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/08/blogpoststoday.gif">one&amp;lt;/a> of my blog outline. See how they're different?	Outlining works on a computer, as long as you revise. It doesn't work on paper because revision, especially of structure, is too hard.I need grad students	&amp;lt;i>Please, this is just a blog post, not an ad. I'm just writing aspirationally. Thinking out loud. You're welcome to listen, but do not feel compelled to act. That would be wrong. However if you're sure you know of a school that could do this, or even another kind of organization, please don't be shy.&amp;lt;/i>	A long time ago, a colleague of mine at Personal Software explained that I do software development as an academic researcher would.	It's still true, but I don't do it in an academic context. And that context is rapidly disappearing in academia, where so many students are now studying computer science not as a way to further the art, but rather to start something entrepreneurial and get rich. 	And there's nothing wrong with that. In some sense, I did that too -- when I was younger. I thought making millions was the way to get validation for my work. My family and the society I grew up in raised me to see things that way. And I was successful, and as a result have been able to work on what I wanted to for my whole career. Pretty good.	Now it's time to take what I've learned and pass it on. There's a huge base of software, most of it open source, that reflects what I've learned. Not just as ideas, but as working code. And programming practices that are, imho, pretty far in advance of what's being done elsewhere. The only problem is, I'm not attracting the students I need to help build something substantial and long-lasting out of it.	I've &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/06/25/myIdealCircumstance.html">outlined&amp;lt;/a> in the past what I hoped for in terms of an ideal environment, from the point of view of the institution. Now I realize that I don't need the institution as much as I need the students. And I can't work with beginning programmers. I'm looking for people who have spend at least a few years learning the basics, stumbling, falling and getting up again. What I have to offer is the equivalent of an actor's studio, for people with extreme talent and drive, to be creative making software. You might get rich from what you learn, but that shouldn't be the point. 	Again, as with the &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/06/25/myIdealCircumstance.html">previous piece&amp;lt;/a> this is not an ad, rather than an aspirational piece. Not looking for advice or "solutions" -- but if you have a compatible goal, I'd welcome hearing from you. Not guaranteeing anything, but I will listen. Update on OPML Comments	&amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/aTestOfOutlineComments">In early Sept&amp;lt;/a> we started working on a new role for the OPML Editor in web content -- as a comment creation and editing tool. It's a different way of doing it, and long-term I don't even think it'll be seen as comments.	Now there's an &amp;lt;a href="http://howtos.opml.org/opmlEditorHowtos/opmlComments">official doc&amp;lt;/a> that explains in a small number of steps how to get going. It takes a couple of minutes. Almost at the threshold of a mass-relevant blogging tool. Getting there.	There are more steps coming, hopefully pretty soon. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/07/wetry.gif" width="145" height="141" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named wetry.gif">And if you're a web architecture kind of person, here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/october/aFunnyThingAboutOutliners#daveWiner">comment&amp;lt;/a> I wrote the other day in response to some questions of my longtime  programming buddy, Chuck Shotton. There's some pretty big dreams about how content should flow that have been realized. 	When Twitter vanished as a possible platform about three years ago, I got busy building what I really wanted. I think in the end it'll seem that Twitter did us a favor by kicking us out of the nest, even though it didn't feel too good at the time.	We're still diggin!	Yes indeed. :-)A funny thing about outliners	An idea that might be foreign to people who write in text editors.	You can use an outliner to write multiple documents.	Try creating a headline called My Diary.	Then every day, add a subhead with the day's date.	And under that write a paragraph about something you learned or did that day.		&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/06/notesscreen.gif" width="686" height="260" border="0" alt="A picture named myNotesScreenShot.gif">	Do it for a few days until the strangeness wears off.	Does this make sense?	Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/06/outliner.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a> of my "worknotes" diary, which is one level deeper.	You can think of every major head under a day as a separate document.	In fact the CMS sees it that way. So I have one document which in turn contains many documents. Actually thousands! 	For many people this will be a new way of thinking about writing.Romney cowardice	When this election is over, we're going to ask the Republicans to apologize to every American for the disrespect they've shown to all of us by trying to make this election an appeal to race hate. 	They can make all the childish excuses they want, but as adults, we understand what they're doing. Even on the debate stage, when Romney talked to the President of the United States as if he was one of his children, and said it exactly that way. 	You know, of all the nasty shit Romney said in the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/romney-ill-never-convince-obama-voters-to-take-responsibility-for-their-lives/2012/09/17/0c1f0bcc-0104-11e2-b260-32f4a8db9b7e_blog.html">47 percent&amp;lt;/a> thing, the worst thing he said was this: "I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." 	That's so self-important, even for a President, to think that somehow it's up to him to convince the rest of us to do anything, much less such personally offensive and outrageously condescending, patronizing, arrogant, irrelevent, egotistic ideas. Imagine if Obama had be caught saying something like that. The hooting would never stop. 	It's up to us, Mr. Romney, to convince &amp;lt;i>you&amp;lt;/i> to slither back into the hole you crawled out of. You sorry excuse for an American. Get a real job. Create something. Do something real with your life. How can I convince you to take personal responsibilty for the nasty shit you say, Mr. Romney.	BTW, now that he says it was totally wrong, let's find out exactly what was wrong with it -- line by line. Each statement in that rant. Compromising Obama	&amp;lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2012/10/04/birdsmall.gif" width="125" height="173" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named birdsmall.png">I hated watching last night's debate. Not because "Obama Lost" but rather than being inspired, as some political discourse can leave you (e.g. Bill Clinton's speeches at the last three DNCs for example), it left me the opposite of inspired -- without hope. Hopeless.	I imagine that the Republicans who had fought with the President behind closed doors know something about him that the rest of us don't. That when cornered, he turns into a bowl of jello. The hemming and hawing increase, and he starts saying idiotic things like "I suspect the Governor and I agree on this." While his mortal enemy is lying, he nods and smiles. Inside something bad is happening with the President, and it's visible on the outside.	So they paint him as an apologist. At first we think it's just talk for the Repub base, but they know that come the debate they are going to be able to get the President to appear to apologize. All that being so agreeable, maybe &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">it's&amp;lt;/a> Stockholm Syndrome. And the Republicans are going to keep pushing him. Romney is not inept like McCain, who Obama aced. Nor is he Hillary Clinton, with whom Obama managed pouty sort of dominance. 	Romney is going to bully the President, and it's up to the President to grow a pair and bully back. We learned something I didn't want to know last night. And we'll learn something else at the next debate, whether the President has friends who will kick his butt. 	And btw, maybe John Kerry wasn't the best person to use as a stand-in for Romney. I wish Coach Walsh was alive to help out here (though I suspect he was a Republican). Maybe Bill Clinton would be a good coach for Obama? Just throwing things out there.The drama of debate	Tonight's debate will be where alternate realities meet up. 	Unlike the Repub debates which were all the same flavor of crazy, this one may have two people trying to live in our world, and a third who pretends the Republican reality actually exists.Scripting.com redesign	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/10/01/tenTons.gif" width="125" height="105" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named tenTons.gif">I've been working up to this for a few months, now it's time to flip the switch and replace the old Scripting News home page with the new &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/">simplified and enriched version&amp;lt;/a>. Yes, it's got more features, but it's even cleaner than before.		1. The menu is at the top of the page, unchanged, as promised. I said it would be a fixture through the transition, so if you found your way around the various sites that make up Scripting News, the links are still be there after the transition. This helps smooth out what I find to be a jarring about website redesign. You know how to find everything and then all of a sudden -- where did it go?		2. There's a new About feature, very easy to find, in the &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/10/02/aboutButton.gif">upper-left corner&amp;lt;/a>, patterned after the approach taken in the Media Hackers &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave">site&amp;lt;/a>. And of course it's an outline, &amp;lt;a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/36518280/outlines/aboutScriptingNews.opml">stored&amp;lt;/a> in my Dropbox folder, so it's reallly easy for me to edit. 		3. The banner is now down the &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/10/02/boldAndBig.gif">left edge&amp;lt;/a> instead of across the top. But continuity is maintained. It's still the same typeface, but it's even bigger than the one before. I think ones' name should be bold and big. 		4. The biggest change is probably the most subtle. The text on the home page is rendered by the new outline renderer in &amp;lt;a href="http://listings.opml.org/system/systemverbsbuiltins/op/render/viewoutline">op.render.viewOutline&amp;lt;/a>. This is the core rendering routine for the worldoutline software, but now it's so core it can be used in any application. So you see every bit of text exactly as it was meant to be rendered. 		5. Comments are back. They of course, never really went away. I moved my editorial act, gradually over to the &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/">threads&amp;lt;/a> site, where it remains now. You can read the articles on the scripting.com home page, or on the threads site. The star at the bottom of each piece links to the page with comments, and the one with paragraph-level permalinks. If you want to point to one of my pieces you should point to the page on the threads site. It's the permanent view. The home page only shows the 25 most recent stories.		6. There is of course still an &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/rss.xml">RSS feed&amp;lt;/a>, in exactly the same place. But there's also now a link in the head section of the HTML to a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.reallysimple.org/worldoutline/dave/2012/09/03/archive132.opml">full outline&amp;lt;/a> of all the text in the new CMS, going back to March of this year when the threads site started. Nothing hard about this, because it's the outline where I do my writing. One big file for everything. 	Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/misc/scriptingSnapshot.html">snapshot&amp;lt;/a> of the Scripting News home page taken just before the transition. 	That's about it for now. Time for me to take a break, and when I come back, I'll fill in the links here and then flip the switch. Maybe tonight or early tomorrow.First October thought	A simple first thought for the tech industry at the beginning of October.	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/10/01/tenTons.gif" width="125" height="105" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named tenTons.gif">If your users are always looking for the catch -- waiting for the other shoe to drop, the 10-ton weight, or waiting for the trap door to open -- you've got a problem. If they don't understand your business, how can they understand your product. How can they understand you? And if they can't understand you -- how can they &amp;lt;i>trust&amp;lt;/i> you?	How naive. To think you might need to have the trust of users to build a company. 	It's not so naive. I think it's actually pretty naive to think that you can go on indefinitely without nailing that one down.	Now, back up a few feet and realize that it's not a single company, but much of an &amp;lt;i>industry&amp;lt;/i> that has this vagueness at its core. Even some of the most prosperous companies are built on a foundation of mistrust with the people they depend on for their existence. 	Feels like the kind of thing you look back on after a bubble-burst and say "Geez, of course that wouldn't work. How could we not have seen that."&lt;/pre>September 2012 = &lt;pre>Ron Paul would probably like this	I'm still on the mail list from the Berkeley neighborhood I used to live in. Today I got an email about a fire on the block. Here's the email, with the names and addresses changed.		Hi,		Last night a bit before 3AM,  Shirley Hellman looked out her window saw flames shooting up from the vegetation in front of George and Helen's home @ 202 Filbert. She called 911 while Barney went across the street and put out the fire using George and Helen's garden hose. He prevented what could have been a devastating fire by his quick, intelligent and brave actions.		By the time the fire department arrived with three vehicles plus a police car, the fire was no longer a danger. They completed extinguishing the fire and were gone by 3:20AM.		My thanks again to Shirley and Barney for saving our block from disaster.		FrankTwitter is a tragic tale	I've known Chuck Shotton since 1995, early days of the Mac web community. I was doing Frontier, an editing and database environment that turned out to be an almost perfect match for web design and programming. Chuck was doing WebStar, the leading HTTP server for the Mac. Our products complemented each other well, and we've been friends ever since. 	I wrote a &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/twitterMayNeedAPlanB">piece&amp;lt;/a> yesterday about Twitter needing a plan B for developers, and Chuck left a comment which I think is worth quoting in full:		&amp;lt;i>Since day 1, I have been unimpressed with Twitter's management team and their ability to grasp the potential of their own platform and capitalize on all the huge opportunities that could come from it. This is just more of the same from them. "Let's take what could be the single biggest transformational change in peer messaging on the Internet and dismantle its value, bit by bit, over the next 5 years and see if anyone notices before we're dead."&amp;lt;/i>	What Chuck says is true.	And we still need to create the layer that Twitter could have created. 	This has always been the disagreement between financial types and tech types. We want to make progress, that's why we got into this field in the first place. I want to be part of creating new layers of technology. So we can be ever more powerful. I like making money, and have made some -- but for me it's just one priority. And once I had enough money to own my own time, it dropped a lot as a priority. I love what I do, but the financial guys mock my love. I've seen them do it over and over, for decades. Jim Manzi, who was then CEO of a big software company, accused me of being Mother Teresa. He wasn't trying to be funny (or if he was, it didn't work).	They think that the only reason to create something is to make money. The more money the better. They're not wrong. When I buy stock in a company, I want them to feel the same way. I say this to counter their belief that I'm stupid or naive. I understand why the VCs want to maximize profits. But I don't think they're doing that. Because they've made a trade-off. By reducing Twitter to sell it as an advertising channel, they are cutting off possibilities that might make money from a wide-open market. And some might make a lot more money than the platform. I don't doubt that will eventually be the lesson of Twitter.	As an example, who made more money off the PC -- IBM or Microsoft? 	Would IBM be better off if they had been able to foreclose on the openness of the PC platform (they tried and failed), or if they had invested in Microsoft? 	There comes a time when a platform has a choice whether the innovation should take place inside their own walls or to let chaos reign in the open market. Having been around this loop a few times, I think the optimal approach is for, after getting to a certain point, the platform vendor to transition from being a programming shop to being a distributor and financier. The choice is between investing in employees or entrepreneurs. The latter is a better choice, always. You just have to look at the history of tech companies to see that. 	Instead, Twitter is going to invest in employees. They won't be able to find enough. There will be disappointment. And there will be competitors. And in a while there will be another shiny new thing. With any luck one of them will be open and the platform will take a back seat to the innovation. And then Twitter will look like a very small place. 	Update: There's a Hacker News &amp;lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4589660">thread&amp;lt;/a> for this piece.How Dave Develops	"Don't Be Evil"		Is Google's commandment.		Mine isn't yet as concise.		But here it is...	Apps must...		Give instant gratification and 		Convey a sense of purpose, yet 		Be deep.	We serve		Designers		Programmers		Writers	Starter apps		In 1984 the Mac could never have made it without MacWrite and MacPaint. 		Gave developers something to emulate. 		Helped form the coral reef.	Where's the catch?		My goal is to deliver an outline-based writing, design and coding platform, and have there be &amp;lt;i>no catch. &amp;lt;/i>		No hidden business model.

It in turn points back to the original, if you want to see the ads, or squint at the tiny type. I'm calling on all site designers to spend 2013 working on making their sites work for readers.

It's not very profitable, I hear. Romney as human being	I was shocked to hear the &amp;lt;a href="http://dropbox.scripting.com/dave/misc/romneyAsHumanBeing.mp3">beginning&amp;lt;/a> of Romney's talk at the Clinton Global Initiative. Why?		1. He cracked a joke.		2. It was good.		3. It was self-deprecating.		4. It got the people on his side.	You gotta wonder why he doesn't show this side of himself when he's not talking to world leaders and fellow rich folk. Like during a debate. Or on the campaign trail.	But it makes his &amp;lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2012/08/24/romney_s_birther_joke_mitt_makes_birth_certificate_joke_in_michigan_.html">birther&amp;lt;/a> "joke" all the more certain to have not been innocent. Here's a guy who isn't tone-deaf to humor. He knows that a good joke has to be self-deprecating or relatively neutral or else it's flat. A good joke tells the truth in a roundabout or surprising way. Furthering an unfair racist insult against an opponent isn't funny. And it's not a sign of him being tone-deaf to humor -- it is however a sign of him having no moral compass. No place he won't go to win. He should have known that people aren't actually that stupid, we get it, even if we aren't in his social or economic class.	I read in &amp;lt;a href="http://www.readability.com/articles/a51muklb">Politico&amp;lt;/a> that he has plans to do bi-partisan deals in his first 200 days to ease gridlock in Washington and gain the confidence of capital markets. A Republican president has that power, where a Democratic president does not. I'm sure he'd face a rebellion in his own party, but they'd have to get in line. So the question is, if this is his plan, why isn't he telling anyone?	Maybe Romney, in a desperate last Hail Mary pass, could come clean, dump his own party, throw them under the bus, apologize, and tell the voters what he really plans to do. It's conceivable that might make the race competitive. Not likely, but not impossible. It would be good for the country, regardless. 	If Romney has a human side, doing something good for the country, even if it might not be good for his candidacy or his party, might not be completely unthinkable.Twitter may need a Plan B	Sometimes the products of acquired companies fade away, but that's not happening with Instagram, &amp;lt;a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion/">bought&amp;lt;/a> by Facebook for $1 billion last summer. "Instagram has a greater pull than Twitter on mobile devices" says the latest Comscore report, according to &amp;lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3001670/instagram-now-bigger-hit-twitter-us-mobiles">Fast Company&amp;lt;/a>.	Problem for Twitter, with their current developer program, they're shutting down Instagram's photo sharing competitors. Which means there will be little opportunity for a challenger to rise, giving Twitter something to acquire -- assuming their own photo sharing service fails to topple Instagram. Which clearly is &amp;lt;i>not&amp;lt;/i> what's happening.Romney's 47 percent	&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/B9xCCaseop4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	I've never seen a more powerful political ad.	Also note it was not necessary to quote Romney out of context.The Angry Birds platform?	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/27/pig.gif" width="148" height="142" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named pig.gif">I bought Angry Alex, and really tried to like it, but got bored and gave up. I ended up going through all the old Angry Birds scenarios dating back to the beginning, instead.	Angry Birds is relaxing. I spend my days writing code and prose, communicating and creating. Playing Angry Birds is not about creating (obviously) it's about &amp;lt;i>destroying.&amp;lt;/i> It's a perfect game. 	I'm sure that Rovio wants to grow, make more money, hire more people -- but maybe that wasn't meant to be. Maybe they should be happy with the success of Angry Birds, and try to do things to make their fans happy. No one would begrudge them some more money if they're helping make our downtime more relaxing. 	Anyway, I seriously think that Angry Birds could be a platform, and that's what they're trying to create with these other products -- including the new &amp;lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/mobile/with-bad-piggies-rovio-strays-further-from-angry-birds-success/">Bad Piggies&amp;lt;/a>, out today, which I admit I don't even want to try, because the idea seems like another Angry Alex, but this time with an element of the Angry Birds franchise.	Instead, why not release the design tools they use to create Angry Birds scenarios, and open a store of their own. Let creativity rule. Even if the scenarios were just ripoffs of the ones done by Rovio designers, so what. Let's see what people come up with.	An idea -- give the pigs and birds recognizable faces. Of movie stars, baseball players, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony. Or Republicans and Democrats! There could have been a special scenario around the death of Neil Armstrong that had him and Buzz as birds fighting off lunar pigs (whatever they might look like).	I think there's still room for a lot of creativity with Angry Birds.

Right now it's easier to write a post and ask you guys to tell me what to get. :-)I thought "stench" was real	Now it &amp;lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/some-people-didnt-really-understand-that-romney">turns out&amp;lt;/a> that Roger Simon's &amp;lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81618.html">piece&amp;lt;/a> about Paul Ryan and the Stench was supposed to be a joke. A few observations.	1. I read the piece, linked to it from my &amp;lt;a href="http://links.scripting.com/">linkblog&amp;lt;/a>, even posted a link to a Google News &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?aq=f&amp;btnmeta_news_search=1&amp;gl=us&amp;gs_l=news-cc.3..43j0i3l2j0j0i3j0l6j43i400.2402.2687.0.4539.6.2.0.0.0.0.1764.2700.6-1j0j1.2.0...0.0...1ac.1.zs_PyPcY_QA&amp;hl=en&amp;oq=Stench&amp;q=Stench&amp;tbm=nws">search&amp;lt;/a> for the word "stench" because I thought it was historic. Like Sarah Palin going rogue in 2008. 	2. It &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/26/politico.gif">doesn't say&amp;lt;/a> it's satire, and Simon is not a satirist. 	3. This is why it's wrong to run April Fools stories, as has become a tradition in the tech world. They're never funny, and you're rarely surprised, and if you are -- is that something a reporter really wants to do to someone who reads them? It would be like a programmer deliberately making software lose data. Not just appear to lose data, and not an accidental bug, but really throw the data away, as some kind of joke.	4. We don't read Politico for this kind of fun. Had it been on The Daily Show or The Onion, we would have known to discount it. But they wouldn't have run it, because it's not funny. 	5. News should struggle to be plain and straight, so we get the information, so we don't have to hunt for it. It's amazing how many times you read a story and they leave out the one thing you would need to know if to act on it. For example, a preview of a football game that doesn't tell you what network it's broadcast on and at what time. Happens far too often. 	6. News itself should not be the story. What arrogance of Simon to think we care what he thinks is funny. If he wants to be a satirist become one. 47% was not a gaffe	There are  silly mis-statements that should have no bearing on the outcome of the election. To call them out amounts to "neener neener" and Americans who are undecided or could change their vote are not influenced by them. Who cares if Romney says windows on planes should open? People who are voting for him will forgive it. People who aren't voting for him think it's significant. But no votes change.	But the 47% line was not like that. It was an unusually clear statement of something very obvious about the Republican &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/03/29/theRepublicanPhilosophy.html">philosophy&amp;lt;/a>. Actually unprecedented. So important that it could not just bring down Romney, but it should also cause people who vote Republican to take another look at whether that's wise.	I used to vote Republican, for the reason I think a lot of people still do. I want a strong country, one that doesn't waffle. I thought the Democrats were nominating people who, as Romney suggests about Obama, were asking for forgiveness. It started with Carter, again, as he says. I see his election as a response to Watergate and Vietnam. We had just spent a decade doing horrible things, and when the truth was out, we didn't trust ourselves. So we elected someone who would &amp;lt;i>never&amp;lt;/i> commit the sins of Johnson and Nixon. It was the right choice for 1976. But then we forgot, and we elected a series of Presidents who in the end were much worse than either Johnson or Nixon. How much worse? Well the 47% idea really spells it out. 	What we need is to find a balance between the horrible governments of the Republicans and the anemic governments of the Democrats. That's why Clinton is so popular now. Even his Oval Office blowjobs look good. We don't want a saint. But we don't want Cheney or Romney either (don't kid yourself about who we elected in 2000 and 2004, it wasn't Bush, it was Cheney, Bush is a campaigner, a very good one, Cheney is governance). 	It would be nice if we Americans could talk to each other about this, instead of talking through the assholes we keep nominating. That said, Obama is not a terrible compromise, despite the atrocities Greenwald keeps reporting. That will change when we change. He's wrong to blame the government. As long as the Democrats have to run in the Republican environment, they're going to have to keep doing the shit they do to keep the bankers, oil industry, pharma, defense industry etc happy. If we ever decide to use our power, even for a moment, that might change. Why Obama didn't meet at UN	I'm not a political reporter, or a partisan (really, I know Repubs think I am, but I'm not), so I can have opinions about these things, and express them, and you don't like it, that's okay.	Anyway...	This is why President Obama didn't meet with any heads-of-state at the United Nations meeting yesterday.	1. If he met with any of them he would have had to meet with Netanyahu. He certainly couldn't have met with any other leader from the Middle East or North Aftrica without meeting with Netanyahu. The noise from Repubs and the press would have been deafening. 	2. He knows this, better than anyone else -- there is no light between Netanyahu and the neocon part of the Republican Party in the US. They coordinate. Share the same goals. It's as if the Republicans here were of the same government as Netanyahu, much more so than they are of the same government at Obama. The disloyalty to America is disgusting, but it's there nonetheless.	3. If he met with Netanyahu, it would be scripted by Karl Rove, they would all know what to say. Netanyahu, masquerading as the head-of-state of a foreign government, as someone independent from the Republicans, would say something that could be spun by the Republicans as showing that Obama was weak. They would have worked this out before-hand. Karl Rove approved this message&amp;trade;. :-)	4. Obama figured the cost of meeting with no one would be less than the cost of going through this charade. He's ahead in the polls. He wants basically nothing more than to run the clock on the election. Give the Repubs nothing to latch on to. A meeting with Netanyahu would give them the opportunity to push him into a corner. 	The press, I suppose, has to pretend that there's no coordination between the Republican neocons here and the Israeli neocons there, but Obama actually isn't weak, and &amp;lt;i>certainly&amp;lt;/i> isn't stupid. There's no reason he should give them ammo. Stay the course. Whatever negative publicity comes from this will pass quickly, because he didn't give the neocons any soundbites or photo-ops to grab onto. 	PS: My link shortener chose this URL for this post. &amp;lt;a href="http://0bb.r2.ly/">http://0bb.r2.ly/&amp;lt;/a>.

It's interesting because Josh is the lead developer of Branch, a discussion system -- and Fred is the backer, and public face for Disqus, the discussion software we use here. 	Fred argues that his blog is open to anyone to participate, but I've noticed what Josh has. While Fred, admirably responds to every comment on his system -- we're not getting much engagement beyond -- hey I'm here. To which you can reply and I'm here, and so am I, etc etc. 	These aren't really discussions, not in any sense that peoples' minds come open to being changed. People come to recite their beliefs, they skim the posts and comments for key words, and then choose from a set of schpiels they memorized, and type them in. 	Online discussions can be a lot like those on CNN or MSNBC, which to me seem like concerts. People are invited to sing their songs, in harmony with other songsters. The songs never vary. The volume does, and each has their own style, but there are rarely any new ideas. 	To me, a good discussion is where a new perspective or fact can surface, and everyone has the possibility come away from the discussion changed. Smarter, better informed, with a possibly shifted point of view. Oh &amp;lt;i>that's&amp;lt;/i> what they mean when they say... 	Miller may be on to something. Branch allows discussion among a pre-set group of people. The moderator, the person who started the discussion can add new people. And new discussions can fork off from previous ones, exactly as it worked on my LBBS system in the early-mid 80s, only prettier (that was in the day of 300 baud modems, and scrolling "glass teletype" displays). 	I still like the idea behind the H20 system developed at Berkman Center about ten years ago. It also had the concept of invited participants. To start, each would post positions on a moderator-supplied topic, privately. Then at a previously announced time, all the positions are revealed. There's a commenting period where each participant can write a rebuttal, again in private. They're revealed all at once. And that's it. The goal is to cover all sides of a topic, intelligently and not personally. Not surprising this was developed at a law school, by lawyers. It's a very legal approach to discourse.	What we really need are experimental platforms for non-programmers to invent new methods of discourse. We've relied too much on programmers, who have a definite style of arguing. But there are other professions that are fairly far ahead of us in understanding how humans communicate and share ideas. We are not that good at it, and so far most discussion systems have been limited by the imaginations of programmers.	BTW, a final note -- in case it isn't obvious -- I am also working on discussion software. There is a place to comment in Disqus, that's open to anyone. There's another way to participate here, by installing the OPML Editor and clicking on the green button you will see when you reload the page with the software installed on your computer.

First, it's optional. Only for the most adventurous users, developers usually. 		2. Next, it's the default, but you can still run the old apps in a compatibility box.		3. Then they require you to install special software to run the old style stuff. 		4. Then they introduce a version of the platform that only runs the new stuff. 	Apple technologies that have transitioned like that include the switchover from the 68K processor to the PowerPC. Then from the PowerPC to Intel. They brought in the NeXT OS that way. It took many years before they shipped a version of the OS that would not run Mac apps from before the transition to NeXT.	People think they're doing that with app distribution on the Macintosh. And some people even think they're phasing out the Mac OS and that at some point they will say that Mac apps are "legacy" and eventually will ship a platform that only runs iOS apps. But that would have to be a long ways off, five or ten years, if ever. 	But this time Apple didn't do a gradual ease-in of their new maps platform. One day we had a maps platform  by Google that mostly worked. It was replaced with Apple's maps technology which is most definitely not ready for end-users. And the Google maps platform is no longer available. It's a remarkably discontinuous change.		Screen shot.			&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/23/mapbig.gif" width="500" height="667" border="0" alt="A picture named mapbig.gif">	It seems they could have shipped iOS 6 with the Google maps platform, and with a new app from Apple that implements their new maps technology. That would get it hundreds of thousands of users, immediately. The most change-averse users would stick with the existing maps app. And the power users, the insiders, those closest to Apple would help them fix the glitches and smooth things out so it would be ready in a year or two for the average iPhone or iPad users.	They certainly haven't explained to users why they didn't also ship a Google maps platform. It's not as if the Google software won't run on the new version of the operating system. You can go to &amp;lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/">maps.google.com&amp;lt;/a> in Safari, and it works as before. 	User communities are layered. Think of concentric circles, like the layers of an onion. There's an inner core of users who are developers. They get the earliest releases of software, and know that what they're getting is both buggy and subject to change. They want that stuff, because they want to be ready when it ships with their own apps. After that there are enthusiasts. People who get glory from being early with the latest stuff. They also don't mind so much putting up with buggy or incomplete software. It validates their view of themselves as pioneers. And there are many more layers of expertise and tolerance for weird behavior, all the way out to the prototype end-end-user -- our mothers. 	It's surprising they would subject all levels of users to the quirkiest software, the stuff that usually only developers have to use, especially mapping software which is integral to using mobile devices. It's almost as if the NYC transit authority introduced new software for the subways, it's really that important these days to getting around. It's a very radical shift, with lots of problems, and they haven't provided an explanation of why it is this way. What other changes like this will they make? Why the change? What other Apple platforms are subject to this kind of change?	See also: &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/technology/apples-feud-with-google-is-now-felt-on-the-iphone.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Apple's Feud With Google Is Now Felt on the iPhone&amp;lt;/a>. 	Update: &amp;lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps/">Letter from Tim Cook to users re maps&amp;lt;/a>.As a renewed Knicks fan	I was a Knicks fan in the late 60s and early 70s. Then I went away until early this year. Jeremy Lin is what brought me back. 	I know a lot about last year's roster. But I can only gather by listening to echoes of Knicks fan frustration that there were some horrible years before that. The names mean nothing to me. But one by one they come back, I read the stories, and they all say the same thing.	This is a crazy team. 	And they reject luck. They have to be smarter than fate. And they make huge impulsive decisions that turn out badly. And keep doing them. Over and over. 	If I didn't know better I'd say the team is run by an idiot.Humanity doesn't scale	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/23/corn.gif" width="135" height="161" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named corn.gif">Everywhere you look there's evidence.	So many of the systems we've built work nice, for now, but when one component fails, how will all the others respond. How is Japan dealing with the Fukishima meltdown? This is a country that depends on nuclear heavily -- they have no oil of their own, and their economy isn't so strong, so what do they do now that they've had a taste of what nuclear-mageddon looks like.	Great &amp;lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all">piece&amp;lt;/a> in today's NYT about data centers. Nice illusion there, but it's not sustainable. Yes that's where our bank balances and medical records are stored. 	What if something happened to corn? Or if we run out of antibiotics? Believe it or not the questions are related. Something that seems as as reliable as corn might not always be so. 	And philosophically and intellectually our minds can't grasp the complexity of the world we live in. That's why politicians who talk nonsense are so convincing. What they're really saying is Relax don't worry, things aren't really as complex as they seem. I can reduce it down to grunts and snorts. 	We have far more people doing far more with technology than our resources can support, than our intellect can comprehend.

I think this part also relates indirectly to journalists who use Twitter.	1. Twitter will provide a way for users to download their history of posts to Twitter.		I was amazed by this. And I don't believe it will ever happen, or if it does it will be in GIF format or PDF, some format that makes it virtually impossible to move the data somewhere else. It would be completely inconsistent for Twitter to offer freedom to its users when it's paying such a high price in goodwill to take away that freedom. 		I think Costolo was caught off-guard by a clever question asked by Ms. Bell, and did what a lot of tech execs do, promise a solution even when they have no idea how to do it, figuring later on they can excuse themselves with a shrug or a joke (as he did in several other instances in this talk, when asked about previous commitments). 		Another clue is that he immediately qualified it as being subject to engineering realities. You could almost see the gears turning in his head. :-)	2. Think of 140 characters as a caption. This is consistent with what they're doing. People who argue that 140 characters is some kind of sacred limit are wrong. They should listen to what Costolo says. 		I think this the right move, not just for Twitter but for everyone.		But it has implications that some journalists might not see. It means that there is no reason why Twitter couldn't host entire news articles. I am sure they will be doing that, probably fairly soon. I suspect this ability will not be open to everyone, and they will want favorable terms for those it permits to use this feature. Presumably there will be a revenue-share on ads placed on these articles.		Also play what-if -- what if Twitter acquires a news organization. Just because they say they are not a news org today does not say anything about the future. Twitter made all kinds of promises to developers that were broken, in total, within a couple of years. 	3. Emily Bell did a great interview. The audience questions were also right on.		I thought Emily Bell did a masterful job of raising these questions to Costolo, but in a disarmingly friendly way. To Costolo's credit he didn't always take the bait. He stuck with the idea that they are a tech company providing a platform, and are not going to cross into content. But he didn't &amp;lt;i>exactly&amp;lt;/i> say that. 		If I were a betting man, I'd bet that before too long Twitter will be competing with its top content providers, the same way it's now competing with its top developers. Only they'll have to tread more carefully there, assuming the journalists and bloggers still have their own mechanisms to get news out. That's why this is such a dangerous situation. As we rely more and more on Twitter, our websites become less-used conduits for distribution of ideas and news.		Obviously I believe Twitter is today a totally inadequate platform for independent journalists or bloggers and it's going in the wrong direction. They score points for not turning over tweets to governments, but they have an awful track record of tiliting the playing field to favor their partners and even personal friends. This is a very sloppily run platform for both development and journalism. People either don't know the history or are choosing to ignore it, presumably because building their own platforms seems difficult, expensive, or unlikely to succeed. However, the longer you wait the harder it will become, not easier. 		&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoculture">Monocultures&amp;lt;/a> don't work very well for news. A comment *and* a blog post	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;no-icons>false&amp;lt;/no-icons>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	Now, any &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/aTestOfOutlineComments">OPML Comment&amp;lt;/a> can be viewed as a blog post, with its own comments.	The links below show how it works.	&amp;lt;rules (blogSectionsRules)>	Links		An &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/itsAFloorwaxAndADessertTopping#daveWiner">example&amp;lt;/a> of a comment on this page.		&amp;lt;a href="http://comments.scripting.com/031/109">Flip&amp;lt;/a> it over and here's the blogpost view.		There's a &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/pensacola/comments/rss.xml">feed&amp;lt;/a> of all the comments.		You can &amp;lt;a href="http://comments.scripting.com/">browse&amp;lt;/a> the comments here.		Of course that's &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/pensacola/comments/index.opml">available&amp;lt;/a> in OPML.		There's a link to the comments in the Scripting News &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/21/commentsInMenubar.gif">menubar&amp;lt;/a>.An open note to Doc	My longtime friend Doc Searls and an outliner guy going back many years is now using the OPML Editor and has started to post items to the OPML Comments community. 	The community starts with the humble concept of a comment, and develops out from there, to create all the essential elements of an online community, but one built around replaceable parts. 		Small pieces loosely joined. It's the philosophy of Unix from the 70s, the PC world of the 80s, the Mac of the mid-late 80s and early 90s, the web and open source communities of the 90s, and the beginnings of Web 2.0 -- blogging, podcasting, RSS. 	It's a good moment, because Doc has wicked way of writing about this stuff. His stories are very different from mine. He goes deep on photography, radio, geography, airplanes. But when it comes to formats and protocols, we are on exactly the same page. He's on the odd-numbered side, and I'm on the even-numbered one.

So the users can not only delight in the experiences each of our software can create, but also in the magic they can create by &amp;lt;i>combining&amp;lt;/i> our tools to create new online communities that the software architects would never imagine. 	My belief is that if the right design, programming and writing tools are out there, and we foster easy movement of ideas, the amazing things we could only dream of in the past will come into existence.

Remember these companies have been suing each other over patent issues.		Tweetie			I don't use Twitter clients, but I understand that their iPad app, acquired from &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Loren+Brichter">Loren Brichter&amp;lt;/a>, was an exemplary iPad app. The new app &amp;lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/09/18/twitter-ipad">apparently&amp;lt;/a> pales in comparison. Again, we don't know how this came to be. But it may be indicative of a similar kind of problem for Twitter.		Ashton-Tate's dBASE			Ashton-Tate is &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art">prior art&amp;lt;/a> for self-destructive upgrades. They had a theory that you could ship a new version of a product, in this case &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase">dBASE&amp;lt;/a>, without anyone in the company actually using it. It didn't work. They ended up selling out to a much smaller competitor after this upgrade ruined the company.			So the stakes can be very high.		Personal note			I learned this one in 1984, when we shipped ThinkTank for the Mac.			People thought we had removed features from ThinkTank, because they had used the Apple II or IBM PC versions. In fact this was a completely new codebase, and we shipped early because there was a lack of software on the Mac. So it didn't have a lot of the features of the earlier product. No matter, the users were outraged by this. They thought they had bought a better computer, and here was the product with less features. We totally didn't anticipate this, because from our point of view it was a major accomplishment to get something out at all. 			As the story goes, the customer is always right. We quickly came out with a new release that added all the features that were in the other versions. A day of construction	You may notice some breakage in OPML comments today. I'm radically restructuring the code. In the end it should be totally transparent, except for things that break in the transition. Once they're fixed it'll be transparent again. :-)Un-Web 2.0	You've heard of unconferences. They take the idea of a conference and flip it around. Instead of having speakers on stage, the speakers are in what used to be called the audience. 		The term has been hijacked to mean something much softer, that the planning of the conference is deferred to the day of the conference. But the speeches are still speeches. The audience asks questions. The experts are on stage. Zzzz.		But the original &amp;lt;a href="http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html">concept&amp;lt;/a>, pioneered at BloggerCon and the term coined by Len Pryor, was deeply disruptive. And it mirrored what blogging was doing to journalism.		Un-Web 2.0 is to Web 2.0 as BloggerCon was to RegularOldCon. And as blogging is to journalism. The source and the destination become one. :-)	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule level="1" to="1">			&amp;lt;no-icons>false&amp;lt;/no-icons>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	So Web 2.0 was nice, as training wheels for the next steps in the future web. A two-way medium. The people who pioneered Web 2.0 are to be congratulated and thanked. But now it's time to &amp;lt;i>Un&amp;lt;/i> it. :-)	Because Web 2.0, while it started out as a freedom-inspiring thing, has been coalescing to being a dangerous form of locking-in the user's data so it can be applied to a corporate business model. We all know the dangers of this. It robs platforms of their openness. It makes moving data around impossible. And it makes creating hybrid systems impossible. It's not a very web-like direction for something that's inspired by the web.	If the Web is &amp;lt;i>Small Pieces Loosely Joined,&amp;lt;/i> Web 2.0 is &amp;lt;i>Small Pieces Trapped In A Silo.&amp;lt;/i>		Hat-tip to David Weinberger for the &amp;lt;a href="http://www.smallpieces.com/index.php">term&amp;lt;/a>. 	In Un-Web 2.0 you get full control of your data, and the services just get pointers to it, or copies of it. The originals live with you. Pointers are much preferable to copies because then you can keep updating the content after it has been incorporated in someone else's content tree.	Food for thought. :-)MP3 of Romney's fund-raiser	Yesterday I posted a &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/questionAboutSoundcloud">question&amp;lt;/a> about the availability of MP3s via SoundCloud. 	I just wanted to listen to this on my walk yesterday. But I also think the MP3s of this should be available outside of SoundCloud's server so they have a chance of surviving over time. So I created an MP3 and uploaded it to my Dropbox account. It's mirrored in my S3 archive. 	&amp;lt;b>&amp;lt;a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/36518280/misc/romneyFundraiserMay2012.mp3">Romney Fundraiser MP3&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;/b>	BTW, I listened to the full recording as I prepared the MP3 and some of what he says is reasonable. But it doesn't seem consistent that one person would say all these things. For example he talks about what a blessing it is to be born in America. 95 percent of it is taken care of for you. Where did that come from? If you started life as an American you were better-off right from the start than most of the other babies born that day, elsewhere in the world.		As a child of immigrants, I can tell you it's true. My parents emphasized the importance of education and my grandparents did very well financially and were able to create security for all of us. So I got an even better start in life. But clearly none of this would have happened had they not been able to come to the US during WWII. 	So how can you at the same time feel that America is great and think that 47 percent of us are losers. It doesn't make sense. At least part of what makes us great is that we have some greatness in our people. Or the system that we live in. It's not just a piece of paper, Mitt. 		We aren't voting for Obama because we are victims, or losers -- some of us are doing pretty well. I'm voting for Obama because I think Romney would be a terrible President. Maybe you should try to earn our vote instead of throwing it away. I thought you worked hard? I thought you were a success? Is this how you achieved so much?	A note about SoundCloud. By now we should all see the danger of trapping our content on a Web 2.0 company's servers. People say that it was Mother Jones' decision to not allow this to be downlaoded, but there were limits on free accounts, so even if they wanted to let everyone download it, they couldn't as long as they used SC. There are other free services that don't have such limits. For example, Dropbox. We should all be working together to be sure that valuble historic documents like this are adequately preserved. It's &amp;lt;i>not good enough&amp;lt;/i> to upload a recording to a commercial service that doesn't allow downloads. Question about SoundCloud	Earlier this afternoon I was looking for an MP3 of the Romney video. 	I noted that &amp;lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/watch-full-secret-video-private-romney-fundraiser">Mother Jones&amp;lt;/a> had SoundCloud versions of the MP3 on the Mother Jones site. But I couldn't find an MP3 download, or a link to an RSS feed for their podcast. 	It's quite possible that I missed it. And that's the question. Is there a link on &amp;lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/mother-jones">this page&amp;lt;/a> for either the MP3 or the RSS feed?	I don't want to jump to any conclusions without clearly asking this question first. Dear Green Button People	I want to show you something about where we're going. 	Here's a &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/18/threadsWindow.gif">screen shot&amp;lt;/a>. That's how I edit the posts on this site.	Does that look familiar to you? If you've already written a few comments, this is what your Comments Workspace &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/18/commentsWorkspace.gif">looks like&amp;lt;/a>. 	Obviously it's a pretty straight line between taking what's in one window and treating it as if it were in the other window. 	"cheesecake"	PS: Go &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/aTestOfOutlineComments">here&amp;lt;/a> to learn about the green buttons.Jury duty, voting and Romney	1. Jury duty is amazing. Especially if you go all the way to a verdict. You learn how the architecture of our democracy places its faith in the people. You might think, if you listened to some of our political leaders, that this would be a bad idea. Because most of us are takers not makers. But it works, because people are a lot smarter, honest and hard-working than we give ourselves credit for. And when you trust people, when you really make that point, and the legal process does that, over and over, &amp;lt;i>everyone&amp;lt;/i> comes through. Some people accept trust faster than others, but in the end, all twelve jurors accept their responsibility. When we passed judgement I was sure we had arrived at the correct decision.		As a juror this is impressive. Everyone stands when the jury comes in. But then everyone, including the jury, stands when the judge enters. Speech is formal, polite, even when they're saying horrible things. May it please the court. Your honor. Mr. Jones. It's all about respect. 		And the jurors must remain silent, for days on end. But the irony is that everyone in the room is waiting for us to speak. You are left with your thoughts and your senses. You look, you listen. Think. What does that mean. What are they really saying. Look at the body language. It's deliberative, almost a meditation. Because the question they're asking is serious. Did this person do something horrible. Something they must be punished for. In the US we don't take this lightly. 	2. Voting is the same idea. You have to look and look at the people who are asking for your vote. Sure they're lying. So was the defendent in the trial. Everyone lies, even if they took the oath saying they wouldn't. Dirty little secret is that if you're on trial, everyone understands that you can lie to defend yourself. And so do politicians. But if you really think about it, you know who they are and what they're really saying, behind the lies.	3. So nothing was actually revealed about Mitt Romney in yesterday's tapes. If you had been watching this guy, like a juror watches every actor in the courtroom, you recognized the pattern. He might have been the guy who runs a company you once worked for. The principal of your school. Your friend's grandfather. To me, he was a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. He was the kind of guy who doesn't know what it means to speak the truth. His existence has nothing to do with the truth. He's a goal-oriented person. He's trying to get something from you. He doesn't care what he has to say to get it. Since he's running for President, a lot of the times that means he's out of his element and you can tell. He's not comfortable with teachers, with working people. But speaking to the rich donors in that dining room, that &amp;lt;i>was&amp;lt;/i> his element. He was comfortable. The same way the defendent in our DUI case would have been comfortable in a bar slamming down a few whiskies before going for a drive. No juror would have been fooled by Mitt Romney before the tape, but what we saw confirmed what we already knew.	I believe in the American system, and totally reject the idea that your vote doesn't matter. You think it doesn't matter because you haven't discovered what it means. If you had a little faith in it, if 25 percent more people had more faith, it would work a lot better than you have imagined. Because given enough time, no matter how much they lie, we figure it out. Change will come slowly but it will come. But don't tell me it can't change if you haven't even tried. I feel a little like a kid	When I was a kid, my friends and I used to ride our bikes down to Shea Stadium and sneak in the back, through the bullpen and out on to the field. Only during the off-season. They didn't have much so security back then.	We'd run around on the field, marvelling that we were running in the same place that the great players of the day were playing. Roberto Clemente, Willie Mays, Ron Swoboda, Ed Kranepool. 	Anyway, that's what I feel like now. Like someone left the gate open and I get to run around on the field and play whatever game I want.  :-)River with JSON-encoded OPML	This is a very bizarre animal.	&amp;lt;a href="http://dropbox.scripting.com/dave/misc/riverWithJsonEncodedOPML.js">http://dropbox.scripting.com/dave/misc/riverWithJsonEncodedOPML.js&amp;lt;/a>	It's a river.js file that has an item that contains the OPML source encoded as JSON.	This means that a jQuery app that loaded this file would find the OPML structure already there in the DOM. 	We're a short step from having &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/">Media Hackers&amp;lt;/a> be able to do something much richer with content.OWS on its anniversary	I've started a half-dozen posts about Occupy Wall Street on its anniversary. Here goes another. 	This close to a national election, I wish they were doing something to try to influence the outcome. What they're doing will just remind people about last year's occupations. I think most people who sympathize with or agree with the premises of OWS (I am one) were concerned with how it would end. Is this really a protest we want to associate with? Becoming homeless and going to jail to make headlines is not my idea of good craftsmanship of political message. 	I've felt in my gut that the right place for freedom-loving people to invest effort is to oppose the most heinous of the plots to control government to favor the rich -- &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression">voter suppression&amp;lt;/a>. If you're going to march somewhere, why not call attention to the places which are most dangerous to democracy? 	Also unlike most people who march I believe votes absolutely do matter. I believe in government of the people, by the people and for the people. True, we've given up most of our power. But what's the best way to get it back? By voting. I'm really serious about that. You can't take it back by getting arrested. You take it back by literally taking it back. And help other people whose votes are being obstructed to get around the obstructions. 		BTW, what taught me the value of the vote was doing jury duty about 15 years ago. The trial went all the way to verdict, so I had a chance to really think about how it worked and what it means. I had always glossed over this part of government. But here we were, 12 very random people, being trusted with a fellow citizen's liberty. We started out as raw cynics, but by the time we had to pass judgement we were true believers in the Constitution. It was an amazing transformation, in all of us, myself included. 	People died to undo the terrible methods of voter suppression in the past. Now we're sitting by and doing nothing while they put it all back in place. Something very wrong about that. Tech discussion of comments feed	Today I released a new feature for OPML Comments, which is explained with links, on this &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/09/17/opmlCommentsWeek2.html">Scripting News post&amp;lt;/a>. 	The core feature is of course the &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/pensacola/comments/rss.xml">new RSS feed&amp;lt;/a> for comments.	If you poke around the feeds, you may find some things that raise questions or possibilities. 	1. The &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/pensacola/comments/rss.json">JSON&amp;lt;/a> and &amp;lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/pensacola/comments/rss.js">JSONP&amp;lt;/a> versions.	2. The &amp;lt;a href="http://microblog.reallysimple.org/">microblog&amp;lt;/a> namespace, which is used by the feed. 	3. The &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/09/11/aRelativelyQuietRevolution.html">roadmap post&amp;lt;/a> that shows where we're going.	4. A screen shot of a &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/17/permalink.gif">permalink&amp;lt;/a> on comments, a necessary feature for the feed.	5. &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.blorkmark.com/?panel=dave">My personal river&amp;lt;/a>, which subscribes to the feed, so it's an easy place to find the latest comments on the threads site (along with news from quite a few other sources).	6. What's next? There's a full CMS behind the comments, with a templating system for designers. Lots of formats and protocols for developers. The only part that's visible is the writing tool. And that's as it should be, because the people we are doing this for are writers and readers. 	Please post comments here, either in OPML or Disqus. Newspapers and blogging	Henry Blodget has a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/newspaper-advertising-collapse-2012-9">graph&amp;lt;/a> showing newspaper ad revenue over time.	Jay Rosen observed that its fall started as the blogs rose.	Proves that the right thing for the news industry to do back at the beginning of blogging was to fully embrace the change. Open the floodgates, and help the new amateurs create news for each other. 	I wrote about this over and over, urged them to offer blogging to their communities. But change doesn't come easily esp when you've climbed the ladder. You don't want to hear the ladder doesn't matter anymore. To OWS -- please use the web	I wish I knew what OWS was doing now and why.	If you don't have a website, here's a space to write. 	Please let me know. I don't understand. Thanks.Why Google is OK	At a recent meeting we were talking about the reversal of fortunes for Twitter and Facebook and wondering why Google wasn't suffering as much. 	It isn't about money because Twitter is shrinking in order to make more money. But the stuff that was exciting about Twitter, the way it acted as a conduit for other software, it was sort of a message operating system on a global scale, the exciting stuff is exactly what they're taking out to get to profitability.	Facebook is wilting because the thing that was lifting them up was their stock, and that's not working for them anymore. In fact it's working against them.	True, Google has multiple revenue flows, but I theorized that that isn't why they have a strong future. It's because they're open where Twitter is not. Think about it. I don't have to be vetted by anyone to be part of their search engine. No one says yay or nay, and there are no funny rules about stuff flowing in or out, or using their code to display search results. Google is fairly laissez-faire. All you have to do to be in their index is to put it on the web, and we all know the web is the platform with no platform vendor. Anyone can put stuff there.	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/15/sorryWeHaveOurHeadUpOurButt.gif" width="125" height="93" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named sorryWeHaveOurHeadUpOurButt.gif">I believe Twitter would have a much brighter future, Facebook too, if they trusted the web. If they let every bit of their service be replaced. That would force them to compete based on service, value and features. Now they get to be lazy and that's fine for a while. But the crazy chaos of the web will eventually do something exciting that you won't be able to match on Twitter. Had they been more trusting they would have guaranteed that whatever excitement comes along would automatically include them. 	Google, on the other hand, has a better chance. It would be good for them if they were more open-minded about accepting formats and protocols from people who don't work for Google, but even with that inefficiency, they still have a pretty strong basis for continued growth.	And of course Amazon is the smartest of them all. They're automatically part of everything because they do everything to support and enhance the protocols of the Internet. They are very respectful of the web and choice. I can deploy my apps on Amazon if I want, but if Rackspace gives me a better deal, Amazon won't fight me. Same with Rackspace of course. This is the way we like it. :-)	Who did Apple bet on in this field? Twitter. They'll never get networking right, imho. (I am a very happy Apple shareholder, btw.)Whole post to Scripting feed	&amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidnin/status/247010855504457728">David Nichols&amp;lt;/a> on Twitter said: "Just realized 'Thread: whatever' posts don't contain the full text in Google Reader. I'm sure you have a reason, I don't get it!"	He's right. The connection between threads and my Scripting News feed is a little temporary glue to connect the old world feed with the flow from the new world. When I did it, I did it quickly, because I was juggling a lot of stuff and didn't want anything to break. 	I gave it a little thought and realized I could easily broaden the pipe to allow full thread posts to go into the Scripting News feed. 	This post is a test, to see if that works. :-)Dear @diveintomark	Just before Mark Pilgrim committed Internet &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Mark+Pilgrim+committed+Internet+suicide">suicide&amp;lt;/a> he posted a tasty little flame about me on Twitter. 	A spammer picked it up and every few days it &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kgp_gov/status/246996072994590720">shows&amp;lt;/a> up in my Replies tab on Twitter, a reminder of how much Mark loved me. Or whatever. 	Here's what it says.		&amp;lt;i>RT@diveintomark: Just a reminder @davewiner ran http://weblogs.com  w/o a privacy policy for years &amp; sold all your ping data #blork&amp;lt;/i>	It's a wonderful slam, something a Republican would be proud of -- because some of it is true -- but it's ridiculous at the same time. And it's packed with intrigue and innuendo.	1. I did run it without a privacy policy. No one ever asked for one. And it was still pretty early for privacy policies (it started in 1999 I think). 	2. A privacy policy would have read like this -- No privacy. The point of weblogs.com was to broadcast all the data to everyone that wanted it. It was a central ping server. For a while it was the only ping server for the entire blogosphere. If you wanted to let everyone know that you had updated all you had to do was send a message saying so to weblogs.com. We then would publish the ping as part of our XML feed. 	3. I did sell weblogs.com to Verisign, but just the domain. No software, no data. The data, to the extent that it ever existed is in a remote folder on one of my hard drives. An Old stuff folder inside another Old Stuff folder, etc etc. All the data was public. In the end it was almost all spam. Not worth anything, that's why they didn't want it.	Anyway, I thought it was worth a rebuttal on a lazy Saturday afternoon, after seeing this message about a thousand times since Mark first posted it. It'll probably be echoing around Twitter's network from now until the end of time. Long after we're all dead people will be wondering who Dave WIner was and why he sold all your ping data and what was #blork and who cares anyway cause they're all long gone.	Happy trails! :-)I don't think this is Kansas	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.fancydress-supermarket.co.uk/dorothy-wizard-of-oz-p-77.html">&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/14/dorothy.gif" width="115" height="250" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named dorothy.gif">&amp;lt;/a>In the 1990s the very small web community, compared to today's web, had a lot of self-important ideas about the future of the medium. We were living in the future and prepared for it, or so we thought. In one way we believed that this would someday be the most important medium, or it already was, but on the other hand, not really. This was the kind of stuff you read about in science fiction, it didn't happen in real life. Well now it's happening. And it's freaky, and who knows where it leads. 	None of us are prepared for the world we find ourselves in. Not even the net natives. 	We don't know  what comes after attacks on our embassies, all over the world now, but it's serious and unprecedented and couldn't happen without the net. Communication used to be controlled by governments. It would take days or weeks for stories of a war-like event in one part of the world to reach another part. I know this because it wasn't much better in the United States. When I was in college in New Orleans, I'd go downtown every Tuesday to get a copy of the Sunday NY Times. That, and the evening news, was my access to world wide news. It wasn't that long ago.	Now &amp;lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/14/us-protests-google-idUSBRE88D1MD20120914">Google has told&amp;lt;/a> the US government that it won't take down the video that's theoretically causing all the trouble. That's weird but it's right. Google is a multi-national company. Sure its founders are American. But it can't be anymore beholden to the United States than to any other country. If they did, they would disappear pretty quickly because someone has a good reason for &amp;lt;i>every&amp;lt;/i> piece of content to be removed. Whether they obey an order from the US is another matter.	Remember, this is all coming after WikiLeaks. And think of where Assange is now. It's only the respect the British govt has for the sovereignty of embassies that keeps him out of jail. And it's exactly that sovereignty that's under attack elsewhere. 	And meanwhile in &amp;lt;a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2012/09/14/obama-birth-certificate-kansas-ballot/70000327/1#.UFPTOKRAZvk">Kansas&amp;lt;/a> some people aren't embarrassed to say the President's name should be taken off the ballot because he's a black man, and they're white and they can't handle it. I know they'll say it's not that, but they're lying. 	All this is happening at the same time. An idea for reporters conducting live interviews	Just heard part of an &amp;lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/full-transcript-george-stephanopoulos-and-mitt-romney/">interview&amp;lt;/a> between George Stephanopoulos and Mitt Romney.	It went something like this.	George: You going to take back what you said?	Mitt: No, basically the White House agreed with what I said.	George: They agreed that the President sympathizes with the people who attacked the embassy?	Mitt: Basically the White House agreed with what I said (repeating his previous statement).	George: You refuse to answer a direct question.	Now, that's what I thought I heard Stephanopoulos say, but he actually went on from there. 	I propose that when you're interviewing someone who doesn't answer a question, that you say exactly those words. "You refuse to answer a direct question." It's like a receipt. Play back for them how you're interpreting. You still get to maintain your lack of a viewpoint. You're just saying what's obvious to everyone watching the interview. And it puts the burden on the person being interviewed. He could smile through it, and that would become the clip you use to summarize the interview. Or you might actually get a response to the question you asked.A question about class warfare	Was just thinking about the Republican tactic of liberal use of the concept of &amp;lt;i>class warfare.&amp;lt;/i> 	If you say taxes should be increased for the richest people, that's class warfare. 	If so, isn't it also class warfare when rich people want to cut health care and retirement benefits for middle class people? Why aren't both ideas equally off-limits? 	No tax increases for rich folk in return for no cuts in benefits for middle class people. Great. Now what? :-)YouTube in the developing world	Pretty amazing that YouTube is playing such a central role in the battles in North Africa and the Middle East. And of course Twitter. A few notes on what's happening.	1. The rioters in Egypt and Yemen say they're incensed by the video. I haven't seen it myself and I don't need or want to. Much of what's there is crap and highly insulting to someone. I'm sure some of the rioters are sincere. I'm equally sure some of the rioters are no more sincere that  the American assholes who look for excuses to get "angry." They're not really angry. They're just using some pretense to try to violently and unfairly shore up their own power, in a highly undemocratic fashion.	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/14/uncleSam.gif" width="125" height="177" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named uncleSam.gif">2. Clearly some of the people on the "Arab street" -- whatever that is -- are being manipulated. They need to understand that not only do we have free speech in the US, there's no guarantee that any video on YouTube actually came from the US. It could have come from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. If not this time, next time. Now that they see how powerful YouTube can be at stirring up mobs, it will be used again and again.	3. The solution is not to censor YouTube, the solution is for the citizens of the new democracies in the Middle East to get clued-in, fast -- to how they're being used. Use your own free speech to expose the assholes. &amp;lt;i>Your&amp;lt;/i> assholes, not ours.	4. We should get rid of any premise in press reports that the rioters are upset about the film. The only thing we know is that they are attacking the US embassies. Are they really so stupid as to believe that the US produced the film? Shouldn't the press check that out before reporting the premise as fact. Could this possibly be some great drama whose purpose is to impose censorship on YouTube? It seems the press has a small conflict of interest here.	5. This is what I mean about tech and politics being inseparable. That the political and tech blogospheres are divided makes the whole thing much weaker. There aren't any divisions any more.	6. On a similar topic, &amp;lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/14/net-us-twitter-occupy-idUSBRE88D01S20120914?feedName=technologyNews&amp;feedType=RSS">Twitter decided&amp;lt;/a> to turn over the tweets of an OWS protestor. It's about time. Either tweets are public or they are not. Twitter needs to answer that question, very clearly. I thought they were public. Just like blog posts. If they're not, Twitter needs to clear this up right now. By not turning over the archive when asked for it, what pretense did they offer? I honestly don't know. Some sense of privacy? Tweets are the opposite of private.Blogging in transition	&amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll">&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/13/dolls.gif" width="259" height="195" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named dolls.gif">&amp;lt;/a>A little over a week ago I wrote a piece called &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/scriptingcomInTransition">scripting.com in transition&amp;lt;/a>. I was getting ready to show people &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/aTestOfOutlineComments">OPML Comments&amp;lt;/a>, and wanted to give you all a heads up. Now you've seen the next step. I've opened up a little window into the CMS running behind the threads site, called the worldoutline, to show you a bit of what it can do. 	Over the last couple of years I did a transition of my blog. First, I rewrote my CMS which had evolved in a disorderly research-driven fashion over several years. That was called Scripting2. Then I started a new CMS called the worldoutline, which was actually begun with the seeds of a way of organizing web content that goes back to Clay Basket in the mid-90s. But this time I achieved the goal I had been trying to reach the previous iterations.	My goal was to create a way of writing, designing and programming for networks that was unified. Where a new domain is just a matter of putting a label on a node saying "Start something new here, and this is its name." Its analogous to a page-break in a word processor. On the net the equiv of a page-break is a domain-break.	Things that used to represent large conceptual changes, like the difference between content and its rendering, are shrunken so you just have to save a document to effect large change on the web. Why not? We already have tools like this for printing and page layout. We're 15 years into the web now. We all create lots of sites, so many that they're hard to manage. We live at the edge of our capacity to manage it. But our tools, the file system and IDEs have only made incremental improvements in the last couple of generations. We're not using the great new capacity of our machines very well. 	So I don't think most people have an expectation for what comes next. That's why this is going to be so much fun. I think you will be surprised at what you will be able to do. :-)A message to Republicans: Enough	The problem with what the Repubs did last night is that we hadn't even begun to process the events. It was six hours before we even knew a US ambassador had been killed. The Repubs are trying to take control of the story. We, the press and the informed electorate -- Republican, Democrat and independent, need to tell the Republican leadership, in unambiguous terms that their behavior, as Americans, is unacceptable. 	Yes, these events are inevitably political. But our first priority has to be the safety of Americans. Maybe our &amp;lt;i>fiftieth&amp;lt;/i> priority is wanting to know what Mitt Romney thinks about it.Do you see a green button on this page?	1. You have to be running the &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/aTestOfOutlineComments">OPML Editor&amp;lt;/a> to see the button. 	2. We've had some reports of people using Chrome on Windows 7 who don't see the green button. If you're a geek, can you help us figure out why? I'm a Chrome user on the Mac, and I see it fine, and there haven't been reports of problems with other browsers. Help much appreciated. 	3. BTW, this is what the button is supposed to &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/11/greenButton.gif">look like&amp;lt;/a> in case you can't see it. 	4. The button is generated by a &amp;lt;a href="http://127.0.0.1:5337/opmlEditor/comments/button">page&amp;lt;/a> on a server on the user's machine. 	Update: Problem &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/doYouSeeAGreenButtonOnThisPage#comment-646852904">solved&amp;lt;/a>! :-)Witting with Greenwald	This post came about from a brief &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/245493500613885952">twitter exchange&amp;lt;/a> with Glenn Greenwald.	Glenn thanks for listening. Here are some simple ideas. (And if you just want the conclusion skip to the end.)	1. Discourse on the net is much like discourse was during the print age. I can write about tech stuff, you can write about political stuff, neither of us gets access to the other's community if you should happen to have something to say to the tech world or I should have something to say political.	2. This is working against us because today almost everything that is political is tech, and vice versa. We've got some smart people writing publicly who can put the pieces together, but we haven't yet actually put the pieces together.	3. You talk about Arab Spring type demos. I say that won't work in the US and I don't think it worked in Egypt. 	4. What works here, and I know this sounds idealistic in a Mr Smith Goes to Washington way, is voter turnout. 	5. Kickstarter. Look what happened there. Why? Because people crave power. They may only be able to put down $10 or $100 but it magically mulitplies quickly to become $1 million. 	6. People are desperate to be involved. To be effective. To do something with their lives that's good. We are missing meaning. 	7. We are blessed with a democratic system that is actually a lot like Kickstarter. If we were to use it, that would change things right off. If voter turnout increased by just 10 percent it would be seen as a revolution in Washington. It would be felt. 	8. I believe it's possible to transform Obama, even just a little. I think he can be manipulated. If 10 percent more people turned out than were expected, it would shake him up. 	9. If somehow we could attach to that a message that the filibusters had to stop, that when we elect a majority to Congress we expect them to have the power to legislate, and that there will be a memory of any politician who threatened that. (Think about the power the Tea Party has had with a small minority in just a few states.)	10. I want to do more than vote and give money. Right now, other than knock on doors, which I did in 2008 and when I was a teen, that's about all that I can do. But I desperatelly want to do more. I thinkn there are a lot of other people like that.	11. I don't care what pundits think. 	12. I believe in demonstrations, but not meaningless ones. Showing up to vote is the best tool we have right now. I can't believe we're not doing more with it.	Anyway, short term there isn't much we can do. I know that. The change that I want has to be something I create myself. I want to break down the walls that say only Josh Marshall, you and Ezra Klein (etc) can write about politics. And that the people who &amp;lt;i>use&amp;lt;/i> the tech have the most important opinions, so I want to hear more vision about where this stuff should go from smart people like yourself. We're creating a new system for political discourse now. The tools are still early. We can make them much better. But first we have to create the expectation that they will get better, and the places we're looking for change are the places it can't and won't come from. The VCs will never give you the power that I will. The President will never bring about change on his own. But you and I and others like us can. Dead people on voting rolls	I love how the Repubs are so alarmed that there are thousands of &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dead+people+on+voting+rolls">dead people&amp;lt;/a> on the voter rolls. OMG. We have to purge them. It's a sign of fraud! This is terrible. Well...	There are also thousands of dead people on Facebook and thousands of dead people with driver's licenses. Every university has thousands of dead people in their alumni databases. Why? Because voters die. And so do Facebook users, and drivers, and alumni. 	My father died three years ago, and while I miss him still, even more today than I did right after he died, I still haven't called the State of New York to say "You need to take my father off the voter roll." For all I know if he showed up at the right voting place on November 7 they would let him vote. But I promise you he's not showing up anywhere. He's a former voter even though he may still be on the voter rolls.	You have to check what the Repubs say very carefully, because while it may be true, what they say might also be designed to lead you to believe something else, something outrageous or fraudulent. That's not happening.A test of outline comments	Welcome to a test of some new software I've been developing. This is a test you can participate in if you have the OPML Editor running on your Mac or Windows PC.	&amp;lt;rules (blogSectionsRules)>	Howto		1. If necessary, &amp;lt;a href="http://home.opml.org/">download&amp;lt;/a> and install the OPML Editor application.		2. Fully update it by choosing &amp;lt;i>Update opml.root&amp;lt;/i> from the File menu.		3. Choose the &amp;lt;i>Your name&amp;lt;/i> command from the Misc menu and enter your name. This will be used to identify your notes in the comments box.		4. Important: Reload this web page. You should now see a green OPML &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/10/greenOpmlButton.gif">button&amp;lt;/a> near the bottom. Click the button.		5. The OPML Editor comes to the front and a window opens with a place for you to enter some comments. Please do so. When you're ready, click the Save button. 		6. Come back to this page and reload. You should see your comments below. You can go back to the OPML Editor and change your comments and Save  as many times as you like. 		It's a social experiment. Let's see what you all do with this. I have some ideas, of course, but let's see how it goes.	Problems? 		If there are problems, you can use the Disqus comment box below to explain. To TechCrunch hackathoners	I hear today is the TechCrunch &amp;lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/why-you-should-come-to-the-disrupt-sf-hackathon/">hackathon&amp;lt;/a>!	If you're looking for something to do, how about picking off one of the ideas on the roadmap for the &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/07/25/anOpenTwitterlikeEcosystem.html">open Twitter-like ecosystem&amp;lt;/a>. 	You could do a nice linkblogging tool. Or a beautiful rendering of &amp;lt;a href="http://riverjs.org/">river.js&amp;lt;/a> in the browser of your choice (or hopefully all of them).	How about a nice way to manage susbscription lists in a way that can be shared with all applications. One place where users can subscribe or unsubscribe. 	Remember to give your users' data to other apps, to be part of an ecosystem. Closed silos are for the big guys. It's how we &amp;lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2012/event-info/">disrupt&amp;lt;/a> them, by working together. :-)app.net's impressive start	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;no-icons>false&amp;lt;/no-icons>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	The Verge has an &amp;lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/7/3300019/app-net-engagement-figures">interesting story&amp;lt;/a> with an awful headline, so rather than point directly to it, I wanted to get a chance to frame it in a way that I think is fair to app.net.	They say that only 250 users account for over half the messages posted on the new system. There are over 20K users, each of whom paid $50 to use the system.	They say this means that app.net is off to a "slow start" but I wonder how that compares to Twitter. I have never seen any good numbers, but I think there are really several classes of Twitter users, I have a sense of how they break out in numbers.	1. &amp;lt;b>Celebrities&amp;lt;/b>, whose grunts and snorts are fascinating to their fans. They don't really provide information, just the tiniest glimpses into the reality of their lives, which are suprisingly like those of normal people.	2. &amp;lt;b>Link machines&amp;lt;/b>, like myself -- people who spend a lot of time online reading stuff, and share links with followers. We post a lot more than the people in category #1. We're not very famous and we don't share a lot of our lives. The product is a linkflow. Another way of looking at it, we use Twitter the way others use del.icio.us (perhaps why the YouTube guys bought it, to turn it into the interesting part of Twitter, imho).	3. &amp;lt;b>Active readers&amp;lt;/b> who use Twitter as if it were a river-of-news aggregator, which of course it is. Yesterday I &amp;lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/september/myLifeOutsideTwitter">posted&amp;lt;/a> a screen shot that illustrates that sometimes Twitter is providing almost exactly the same flow as the &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.blorkmark.com/?panel=dave">Media Hackers&amp;lt;/a> tabbed river.		&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/06/greattweets.gif" width="537" height="554" border="0" alt="A picture named greattweets.gif">	4. &amp;lt;b>Darknet users&amp;lt;/b>. I have no idea who they are or what they do or if they are even real people. A huge portion of the numbers on Twitter. Who they are is totally unknown. Like the interior of Alaska or Siberia. 	Unless we know how things break down for Twitter how can we judge what's happening on app.net. For one, I am impressed. They have managed to get uptake, with a $50 pricetag, for an offering that is actually less functional than Twitter in many ways, from a technical standpoint. And it's a very small community relative to Twitter. Even so, they have managed to get a lot of people to part with a significant amount of money. And they're smart to go into a quiet period for a while to consolidate, and presumably get some new software ready, and perhaps some content deals.Breakdown of feed formats	A question came yesterday up on the &amp;lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/river-of-news">river-of-news list&amp;lt;/a> -- a list of developers who are creating tools and designs for rivers. 	&amp;lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/river-of-news/tts9bcZLrk0/IbUSnw6RkXsJ">Dody Gunawinata&amp;lt;/a>, is doing an aggregator and wanted to know if he should support RSS 1.0 format. I said that River2 does, but I didn't know the breakdown of different feed formats. 	So I wrote a script that recorded, when a feed updates, whether it's RSS or Atom, and if it's RSS, which version it is. Only feeds that updated in the 24 hour period would be counted, and each feed would only count once. The idea was to count feeds that were actually updating. Dormant feeds really don't matter for Dody's question. 	I ran the script overnight on the server that maintains &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave">my rivers&amp;lt;/a>. So this is a very unscientific test. 	The numbers: RSS 2.0 -- 338 feeds. Atom -- 36. RSS 1.0, 0.92 and 0.91 had 2 each.Life outside Twitter	&amp;lt;rules>		&amp;lt;rule>			&amp;lt;no-icons>false&amp;lt;/no-icons>			&amp;lt;/rule>		&amp;lt;/rules>	I've made an investment over the last year, building up the &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/">rivers I use&amp;lt;/a>, both from a software and content standpoint. I've realized more and more that's how I was using Twitter. To be in the loops of writers, both professional and bloggers, in a systematic way. I wanted to see how rich I could make it.	Turns out it's pretty good. I still use Twitter, and for now that's okay. 	A few minutes ago there were five posts on Twitter, in a row, that I would love to have outside of Twitter too. Expand this headline to see the screen shot.		&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/06/greattweets.gif" width="537" height="554" border="0" alt="A picture named greattweets.gif">	Except for Newyorkist announcing that he is making his bed, each of the tweets is from people I feel I know well through their online personnas, and each is pointing to something worth reading. 	Bora Zivkovic is a scientist blogger from North Carolina. Philip Greenspun is a genius entrepreneur, systems guy, developer, pilot, libertarian. Highly opinionated, great writer. Jay Rosen is of course always on-topic, a thinker and linker and media observer. Miguel de Icaza is a great community leader, programmer, and is politically outspoken (like me and Greenspun) and Chris Dixon is a NYC-based entrepreneur, VC and also a wise guy. :-)	I would subscribe to any of these guys in my rivers, and in fact I do. Most of the content they're pointing to exists on the web, outside of Twitter, but I'm not subscribing to all of it. I want people like Chris and Miguel to have a linkblog, so that their links live outside Twitter as well as their writing. 	These are all super smart people and I think they will immediately understand why it's good to have feet on both the &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/07/31/oneFootOnThePlatform.html">platform&amp;lt;/a> and the train, at the same time. About Twitter's changes	There's nothing surprising in the changes Twitter &amp;lt;a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/overview#JSON_support_only">announced&amp;lt;/a> today. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/05/silo.gif" width="125" height="152" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named silo.gif">They telegraphed clearly, a long time ago that they were phasing out their earlier developer program. Earlier this year Twitter CEO &amp;lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/23/3180005/twitter-ceo-dick-costolo-walled-garden">Dick Costolo said&amp;lt;/a> they wanted more content flowing into Twitter and less flowing out of it. So of course that meant that they would cut back on  API access. If anyone had been building on these resources, they now face a setback, but it was one they could have seen coming. 	Twitter could have been something very different from what it's becoming. That's neither good nor bad. Every business has an opportunity to define itself, by what they do as well as by what they &amp;lt;i>don't&amp;lt;/i> do. Twitter has had very strong positions like the 140-character limit and the decision to put links in the text that users type. These have become such fixtures that we hardly notice them. But different decisions could have been made, and a different environment would have resulted.	When Twitter pulls back from features, they create room for new potentially valuable networked products and services that are radically different from Twitter, with different tradeoffs. I think we're at the point in the evolution of the net where there will be a lot of experimentation, in part fueled by the new space Twitter is opening up for competition. It's good for innovation. I think we may well be getting unstuck in some very big areas, very soon, as a result of the changing developer landscape.	See &amp;lt;a href="http://tabs.mediahackers.org/">Media Hackers&amp;lt;/a> for an idea of what can be done with news, entirely outside of Twitter, based on flows in RSS, Atom, XML and JSON, all of which are strong open formats with huge content flow from professional news organizations, bloggers, universities, schools of all sizes, scientific institutions, corporations, non-profits, media networks and government agencies. 	It's important to note that none of this is in any way subject to Twitter's terms. None of these feeds or JSON rivers will stop flowing because Twitter is placing limits on its own &amp;lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html">ecosystem&amp;lt;/a>.	There are new projects from many developers that look promising. I believe there will be strong reasons the new projects will want to share user content more fluidly as a way to compete with the giant companies that are trying to carve out private areas of the Internet, as Twitter is. 	Working together is how new markets are always created. There's lots of new stuff in the pipe, much reason for optimism and excitement. :-)scripting.com in transition	I'm doing more of my blogging over here on the threads site. 	This was always the plan. When people say that I turned off comments, that wasn't exactly true. I wanted to start a transition from a site where discourse was more controlled, and set off from the main blog content.	There is more transition coming, some things I hope that many people will find exciting. 	I think there's a new kind of writing for the web coming. I want to be a major proponent of it, and participant, as I was in the early days of blogging and podcasting.	Feel free to post a comment below (but keep it nice). :-)Why a second term for Obama?	&amp;lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21561890">Economist&amp;lt;/a>: "A president who has had a patchy first term now needs to make a convincing case for a second one."	Pretty simple. Romney repeats a promise that he'll "repeal ObamaCare."	Obama will implement it. By the time his second term is over it will be a done deal.	Even if Obama did nothing else, it would be worth it to re-elect him just for this.	&amp;lt;b>A little background&amp;lt;/b> 	Ten years ago I had life-saving surgery. It cost over $400K. And over the years since, my health care has been pretty expensive. I'm well-off. I can afford my health insurance. And I've had continuous coverage since I was in my 20s. So the insurance companies have to cover me.	But I understand what it would mean to not have the money and not be insured. I would have died ten years ago. So this means something to me personally. 	I also have friends whose life requires maintenence from the health care industry to hold death at bay. If you look around you, and ask -- you'll find that there are many people who are in a similar circumstance. Not everyone likes to talk about it, but it's happening anyway. 	People who don't understand are imho:	1. Young.	2. Have never experienced the death or serious illness of someone they loved and/or depended on.	3. Are not paying attention. Probably an alchoholic or drug abuser, because it's all around you. You have to work at not seeing it. Work hard.	That we would play games with health care for our families is ridiculous. I guess Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney don't have any friends or family who might be at risk. But that can't be true for most Republicans. So I honestly don't understand. But I don't have to understand if we simply re-elect President Obama.	Q.E.D.Ann Richards 1988 keynote	&amp;lt;iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wtIFhiqS_TY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&amp;lt;/iframe>	One of the best speeches ever.Repubs lie and obstruct, but Obama does not lead	The Repubs tell the truth about one thing, and it's the one thing that damns the president. He hasn't been leading. Campaigning for re-election is not leading. 	I'm going to vote for Obama no matter what. Not voting is not an option, and voting for Romney is &amp;lt;i>most definitely&amp;lt;/i> not an option. If the Repubs were to control both the executive and legislative branches we're in for a whole other level of catastrophe. Last time they ran the country we almost lost everything, economically, militarily as well as our freedom. The whole thing. 	What has to happen is the Repubs have to be reined in. And the President has to lead us to that future. He can't just get re-elected. It has to be more than that. The real liars are the press	Who can really blame the Repubs for lying if the reporters let them get away with it.	I read a &amp;lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/02/us-media-neutrality-presidential-elections-lies">piece&amp;lt;/a> by Emily Bell about how media neutrality is fueling lies. It's pretty radical considering  she teaches jouralism at Columbia.	But the truth is much more radical. The Republicans are finally taking down the press. What will be left of journalism after this election will not resemble in any way what it was before. This is a moment of breaking with the past, a discontinuity, reformation. 	Finally it's obvious to everyone that the news is not being reported accurately. What we see and hear in the speeches in the cable news broadcasts is different from what they report. Could not be clearer. We see A, they report B. 	If the headline is wrong, then now is the time for the press to stop lying. I would love for that headline to be wrong, but right now, it's correct.Embedded registration form	&amp;lt;iframe id="gottaregister" name="1_1" src="https://gottaregister.com/?brand=embed&amp;source=http%3A%2F%2Fthreads2.scripting.com%2F" width="450" frameborder="" height="380" style="display: block; overflow: hidden; margin: auto; background-color: whitesmoke; padding: 20px; border:#c2dbe8 1px solid; moz-border-radius: 0; webkit-border-radius: 0; border-radius: 0; ">&amp;lt;/iframe>	Note: I used the Obama campaign's &amp;lt;a href="http://www.barackobama.com/registration-embed">embeddable form&amp;lt;/a>.

As a result, if he wins a second term, Mr. Obama plans to remain in campaign mode." He's quoting a WSJ article, which unfortunately is behind a paywall.	This is the most sigificant thing I've read about his presidency. He realizes now that he has to be in full-time campaign mode. That's the power of the presidency. You'll have no leverage with Congress unless they know you have the voters on your side. All he had to do to understand this is read a little history about the most &amp;lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=theodore+roosevelt">effective&amp;lt;/a> &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_chats">presidents&amp;lt;/a>. They were the ones who had open channels of communication to the electorate, &amp;lt;i>and used them well. &amp;lt;/i>	This is, btw, the one valid part of the Republican campaign. When they said he wasn't showing leadership, I didn't know what they meant until Christie's &amp;lt;a href="http://gothamist.com/2012/08/29/gov_christie_introduces_president_c.php">speech&amp;lt;/a> at the RNC. "Real leaders don't follow polls. Real leaders change polls," he said. He was absolutely right. A president who doesn't get that is one who isn't using his power effectively. Then there's the question of what the president would use the power for, and that's where I can't go with the Repubs. They would try to take us back to some fantasy United States that never existed. 	Today is different. We're switching the way economics, communication and war work. The military that the Repubs wants to double-down on is, as always, designed to fight the wrong war. The next war will not involve terrorism or huge armies, you can attack the infrastructure of your enemy and cripple them with algorithms, code and passwords. 	&amp;lt;img src="http://scripting.com/images/2012/09/01/tr.jpg" width="90" height="113" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named tr.jpg">Back to the &amp;lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_pulpit">bully pulpit&amp;lt;/a> of the president of the United States. The unique opportunity now is that communication doesn't have to be 1-way. This is where media hackers come in. I hope they open their doors and minds to us so we can get involved, not just as voters, but as innovators. This is why I was so disappointed when I saw the whitehouse website in January 2009. It told me everything I needed to know about what they didn't understand or want to put into practice. 	It's like everything. Just getting funded doesn't mean your business is successful. The hard part is yet to come. You can practice medicine after getting your degree, but whether you're a great doctor is still yet to be determined. Getting elected President is a huge accomplishment, but that's just where teh fun starts. And it's not just the Republicans you have to get to line up, you have to get members of your own party to do it too.	This was all covered on the West Wing, btw. :-)	One more thing. If you're good at communicating the Repubs know what to do then -- they'll impeach your ass. So be prepared for that too. OK?	PS: Seeing the President on Reddit was a very positive sign, btw. 	PPS: Doc Searls could play the mature Teddy Roosevelt in the movies.&lt;/pre>
